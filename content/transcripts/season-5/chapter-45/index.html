<p class="direction">IN THE SILENCE WE HEAR LIBUZA AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once upon a time, there was a builder.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE HOWLING WINDS OF AN ICY PLANET AND FOOTSTEPS SLOWLY APPROACHING.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Builder had lost his workshop, lost his tools, lost his way. He wandered on icy plains on a distant planet.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Had to be a fucking ice giant, huh?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is death by fire and death by ice. Both are merciless, but at least fire is quick. Ice takes its time. Ice slowly creeps in. Ice gives you time. Time to regret, time to fear, and the worst of it: time to hope. The builder had no choice but to hope.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay Leif. At least get out of the wind.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF KEEPS WALKING.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a strange magic that brought him to this frozen land. He had been banished but his banishment could only occur in a place he had touched in the past. For all of us, how many places could that be? So few of us move from place to place all our lives. But for the builder, there were few stars in the sky he hadn’t touched at least once. As far as he knew, he could be anywhere.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SHORES OF AN ICY OCEAN.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Builder took shelter in the shadow of a cliff by an icy sea. Shelter from the wind would postpone his death but extend his misery.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really regretting my decision to have visited so many shitty planets over the course of my life...</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar probably landed in Bakersfield... I’d give my right lung to be in fucking Bakersfield right now... okay... okay, where are we, Leif? Let’s think back... Ice giants I have known... Castriff... Celestiani...</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re only as lost as your mind allows you. The Builder had spent a life among the stars and knew clusters of dust like one would a curve in an ancient road. He searched the night sky to see what it could tell him.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Quilandis... Of course it’s Quilandis, it wouldn’t be poetic if it wasn’t Quilandis... I hate poetry...</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Builder realized he had once made his home here. A long time ago, when all hope was lost, he crawled into a hole between two mountains and waited for the end to come. When he finally left, he hoped he’d never see it again.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright... there’s only one ocean on Quilandis... I lived about thirty kilometers away from it...</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF WALKS AROUND TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE LANDSCAPE.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There... if my hideout’s here it’ll be between those two mountains... thirty kilometers... if I try to walk thirty kilometers... I’ll die... if I stay here I’ll die... Fuck.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is a Knight without his sword? What is a farmer without his field? What is a builder without his tools? The builder tried to remind himself of the first rule he ever learned...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There is only one tool... inventory... H20. Matter state: solid... H2O mixed with NaCl. Matter state: liquid... Water and saltwater, that’s all I’ve got to work with... that is not going to do it... I’m fucked... maybe I try and huff it... I did 35 seconds in the void of space one time, I could do thirty kilometers in, I’m guessing, negative 10 Celsius without any protective clothing.... sure... sure I could... No, I can’t. Fuck!</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tools are irrelevant without materials. The builder had taken stock of his materials and as far as his eyes could see he only saw ice, water, and salt. It wasn’t enough.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF TURNS ON HIS PAGER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What can I do with you?... Nothing... You saved my life and you’re totally useless right now... I hope it’s going better for you guys out there... Where’d you wind up, Gloria? Back at Jack in the Box? Ava, you probably landed in some high-armed leather chair surrounded by dudes with elbow pads... not me... no, I get the fucking ice planet.</p>
<p class="direction">A MASSIVE SEAL-LIKE CREATURE EXPLODES UP OUT OF THE WATER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit!</p>
<p class="direction">THE MASSIVE CREATURE PULLS ITSELF UP ONTO THE ICY BEACH, BELCHING AND ROARING.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus... Well... hello there... Nice to have some company... what’s your name?... I’m Leif... I’m going to be dead soon... of course I could try and kill you and live inside your body Han Solo-style... But you are twelve feet of blubber and I just have a space pager... wait...</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF RIFLES THROUGH HIS POCKETS AND FINDS THE SECRET HANDSHAKE.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Secret handshake... fifty thousand volts is just going to make you mad, isn’t it?... Fuck... well, nice to meet you anyway.</p>
<p class="direction">THE CREATURE ROARS AND TAKES A GIGANTIC SHIT ON THE BEACH.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my GOD! ... ugh... Seriously?</p>
<p class="direction">THE CREATURE TURNS AND CRAWLS ITS WAY BACK INTO THE WATER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come on, man... Oh my God, the smell... So excited that this will be the last thing I ever smell...</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s odd, The Builder thought, how anything can be a gift if it’s given at the right time...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Hang on... H2O, NaCl, and now... CH4... iron, copper, depending on what you ate today... Methane gas could ignite... it’ll ignite sure but that’s one big flash... high moisture content of the fuel source makes a continuous burn pretty tricky...</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF STARTS LAUGHING.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re really missing out guys. I’m trying to save my life by lighting a gigantic pile of shit on fire... there’s a metaphor in there somewhere... Okay, humungous shit pile, how do I light you on fire?... In one hand I have a space pager... looks like Paradise Leif made this thing pretty efficient so I won’t get much juice out of it. In the other hand I have the Secret Handshake. Can deliver a quick burst of fifty thousand volts BUT... low wattage... I’m going to need sustained heat... Environmental concerns: fuel source, AKA shit pile is steaming right now but I imagine will be frozen within an hour. Whatever I do I’ll need to be ready to do it by the time the next guy wants to take a dump on the beach... Sustained heat... sustained heat...</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When the solution finally came to him, it didn’t arrive as good tidings. Like any escape from certain death, this solution would require a sacrifice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sunrise in about four hours... let’s get to work...</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF LEIF KICKING AT THE SOLID ICE OF THE CLIFF WALL. BITS AND PIECES OF ICE CHIP OFF AND LAND ON THE GROUND. IN BIGGER AND BIGGER PIECES.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Builder needed one tool to live, but that tool was buried in the wall of ice before him. He kicked and kicked at the wall as the shards of ice fell around him. He was finally surround by fragments of ice, large and small.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Out of breath.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... several hunks of ice...</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which one of you is the lucky winner?... I need you to be the size of a dinner plate... any takers?... You there... you look like you’re up for the job.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF PICKS UP A LARGE PIECE OF ICE.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, big piece of ice, I’m about to turn you into something beautiful... it’s going to cost me, but all beauty comes at a price, am I right?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">All beauty comes at a price. The sculptor blinded by marble dust, the painter driven mad by the poison in their paint, and now The Builder. Using the warmth of his hand he would slowly melt and shape the fragment of ice. He was careful to only use his left hand, then after his hand was too cold, his left arm, then back again to his hand. Over and over again, smoothing the edges, slowly shaping it into the only tool that could save him.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mr. Thorvladson, I’ve dealt with prodigies before, and I will say to you what I’ve said to all of them... No amount of intelligence will make up for flawed optics... clean your optics every morning, Mr. Thorvaldson. FUCK, that’s cold... Goddamn it... keep going, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Into the morning he shaped the ice to his will. As the sun rose it offered little comfort, the star was distant and cold, but he did not need the sun for its warmth.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Out of breath.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... ideal angle is 17 degrees above the horizon... Leif... you’re going to need both of your arms for this part... You can’t feel one of your arms right now but it’ll still respond... I think two minutes will do the trick. Two minutes is all we need okay... Just waiting for the guest of honor now.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He waited in the frigid morning for the last phase of his plan. One arm numb, the rest of him not far off. The only thing left was a little bit of luck.</p>
<p class="direction">ANOTHER MASSIVE SEAL EXPLODES UP OUT OF THE WATER AND PULLS ITSELF UP ONTO THE SHORE.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, gorgeous... come on... come on you know that’s why you came here...</p>
<p class="direction">THE SEAL TAKES AN ENORMOUS CRAP ON THE BEACH.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great work, pal.</p>
<p class="direction">THE SEAL PULLS ITSELF BACK INTO THE WATER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two minutes, Leif!</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF YELLS IN PAIN AS HE LIFTS SOMETHING ABOVE HIS HEAD.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Builder raised his new creation above his head. It was a massive lens. All night long he had used his own hands to make a lens made entirely of the ice that was trying to kill him. The lens would gather the rays of the sun into a beam. And with enough time... The Builder would make fire from ice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come on... come on... hold it steady...</p>
<p class="direction">THE ENORMOUS PILE OF SHIT ON THE BEACH SUDDENLY BURSTS INTO FLAMES AND CONTINUES TO BURN.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah!! Ahhhhhhhhhh! Hahahahahahahaha! Fucking fire, baby!</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF GETS CLOSE TO THE FIRE.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my god that smells like a chemical plant but the heat is glorious... FUCK YOU I MADE FIRE!... You’re still sucking in air, Leif... somehow...</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Builder fell into a deep sleep next to his fire made from ice. His dreams were strange dreams of warmth... an endless celebration by a crystalline ocean, an argument with a friend on a train. A warm body in a warm bed. Bright, white, sharp teeth in the darkness whispering “I love you”.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF WAKES UP WITH A START. THE HUGE SEAL CREATURE IS LAYING AROUND THE FIRE WITH HIM.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh... Hey there.</p>
<p class="direction">THE SEAL GRUNTS AT HIM.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pretty great right? It’s fire. It’s one of the things that separates me from you... One of the many things... I uh... I have no idea what your kind is called so I’m just going to call you J Shmoe, okay?... Ow! Fuck... Mr. Shmoe if you could remind me not to touch my left arm, I’d really appreciate it... Jesus Christ I can’t believe I lived... Barely... Sadly this isn’t going to do it, J... this is a temporary situation... Thirty kilometers... thirty kilometers inland, that’s the next step... How am I going to pull that off?... Sun’s going down... if I don’t have a plan by tomorrow I’m dead... know any campfire songs?...</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">All through the night The Builder tried to convince himself that he didn’t already know the plan. The plan came to him almost instantly as soon as he awoke. All through the night he tried to think of any other plan. Anything that could keep him from doing what he would have to do next... nothing came.</p>
<p class="direction">THE NEXT MORNING WE HEAR LEIF WALKING AROUND THE CAMPSITE. THE SEAL BARKS AT HIM.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? Oh, all this? Well, believe it or not my blubbery friend, this is the plan. I have here in my arms, several pieces of your frozen shit. I will now sit down by the fire and take my boots off.</p>
<p class="direction">THE SEAL BARKS AT HIM AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re right, it does sound crazy. But I’m afraid that’s all we’re left with.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF TAKES HIS BOOTS OFF.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I take a moment and warm my feet by the fire and then... I take my right boot and fill it with frozen pieces of your incredibly stinktastic shit, Mr. J. Shmoe... I fill it all the way to the top of my boot. I now have one boot full of shit, one empty boot and two socks... I take two socks and put them...</p>
<p class="dialogue">on my right foot, and then I take the empty boot and put it on my left foot. I lean the shit boot up against the fire and I wait for it to thaw enough that it catches on fire... I knew this guy back home... Lenny. Lenny Harris... Cool guy... I was packing up my stuff, heading off to Berkley. I told him I would fix his bike for him so of course I added a motor to it because I can’t fucking help myself... “I’m finally going to get out of here,” he said... “Oh yeah? Where you going, Lenny?”... He said “Micronesia.” “Micronesia? What the hell for?”... “They’ll never find me there,” he said. This was a seventeen year old kid talking like he was on the run from the feds... “You know, Lenny, the problem with nobody being able to find you is that nobody’s able to find you.”... Should’ve taken my own advice.</p>
<p class="direction">THE TOP OF LEIF’S BOOT CATCHES FIRE.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here we go... I have turned my boot into a torch. The fire will burn at the top and slowly thaw the fuel underneath and then use that to keep burning. That should be enough heat to keep me from dying at least.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF GETS TO HIS FEET.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Time’s a wasting... J Shmoe, my friend, enjoy the fire. Theoretically if you keep coming ashore and shitting on it, you can always have a fire up here. An eternal flame... a memorial... thirty kilometers... piece of cake.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">With a torch and only one boot on, The Builder made his way across the land of ice. The wind was constant and relentless, even when the sun was at it’s highest, it was as though it burned cold. It wasn’t long into the journey that time became irrelevant. He could’ve been walking for minutes, he could’ve been walking for years. There was only one way he found to motivate himself. He thought of his death. If he were to die here, his body would never decompose and become part of the Earth. He would be frozen. Trapped forever. Wide, dead eyes gazing at the sunrise for eons until even the sun burned out. If he died he would never be free.</p>
<p class="direction">INSIDE LEIF’S OLD HIDEOUT. WE CAN HEAR THE WIND HOWLING OUTSIDE.</p>
<p class="direction">AFTER A MOMENT THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN AND LEIF STUMBLES IN, HE IS BREATHING HEAVILY AND KNOCKING THINGS OVER AS HE CROSSES THE ROOM. WHEN HE REACHES THE FAR WALL HE PRESSES BUTTONS ON IT AND AN EMERGENCY BED DEPLOYS.</p>
<p class="character">MED-BED</p>

<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... Losing your arm in the Justine Burbank system, huh? Sounds a little familiar to me.</p>

<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d watch yourself, Buster. Everybody loves the freewheeling old man... but all I was ever meant to be was a cautionary tale.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m aware.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">With certain death narrowly avoided, The Builder changed his focus as the chemicals seeped into his body. He thought of those that sent him here. His enemies. The ones that took his friends from him, the ones that condemned him to an icy death. As he thought of them he issued a promise the empty air...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m going to kill every single fucking one of you.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Builder had become The Destroyer. As every builder does from time to time. The key is knowing when the destruction must stop. Sometimes it never feels like enough.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... Who do you think got him?</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re telling me that you and my husband are on the brink of a scientific breakthrough.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so, yes.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’re an Earthling.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not known for our scientific breakthroughs.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m a bit of an outlier.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">In several ways.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">In several ways.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(To Hannes.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I told you you could be tracked through those games.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know you did.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We could’ve had someone much worse than Jeremy showing up at our door.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know that now.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In her room.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s out there?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terrwyn we’ve got company, why don’t you come out of your room?</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who is it?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not having a conversation through a door.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Give me a hint.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s our daughter Terrwyn, she’s going to be the president of something one day but right now she’s just a pain in the ass.</p>
<p class="direction">TERRWYN OPENS HER DOOR AND WALKS OUT.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello there.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, I’m Terrwyn.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, I’m Jeremy.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s nice to meet you, Jeremy. Jeremy don’t you agree that this visor I’m wearing is too big for my face and makes me look ridiculous?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure you’ll grow into it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">But Jeremy, don’t you agree that it makes more sense for me to wear my adolescent visor which fits me much better.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you should probably do whatever your mom says, Terrwyn.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to need a better answer than that, Jeremy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. How about the fact that, you appear to be a Crimson Nyxite, and if you don’t wear that visor you’ll be blind.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Granted, but I offer a counterpoint.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How old are you?</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">My adolescent visor fits me much better, why should I be forced to wear the visor I don’t like?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because your parents told you to.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see. So we’re to be enemies, you and I?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terrwyn, don’t drag Jeremy into your personal crusades, please.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I look like I’m wearing a spacecraft on my face, dad.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t look like that at all.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jeremy, you’re an Earthling.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yep.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you get here?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a very long story.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, you’re in luck, Jeremy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is that?</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because when my parents informed me that I was going to have to wear a visor on my face that was roughly the size of a planetoid, they also told me that I was now going to be spoken to like an adult in the house. Mom, can you confirm that, please?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did say that, yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay then. Let’s hear it, Jeremy.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, Winnie, I think we all want to hear this story. How about we set up the table for all of us and Jeremy can tell us a story?</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hannes, can you put some music on please?</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="direction">MUSIC PLAYS AS WE MOVE TO LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. LEIF TELLS HIS STORY.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Anyway, so there we were at the top of the mine with a cadre of Teds waiting for us. They said what we created was too much too soon for the human race and that they would like to make us all a deal.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">A deal?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">In exchange for what?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">In exchange for pretending like we didn’t discover something.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s true.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did you discover?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dark matter.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Earthlings haven’t discovered dark matter?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This Earthling did.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">But they wanted you to keep it a secret?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They did.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you just said okay?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean... it was a long time ago. I was a kid, and suddenly I’m confronted by, not just an alien race but confirmation that there were aliens to begin with.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">A discovery like that would’ve transformed your planet.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would it have?</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">An unlimited energy source for a planet that’s still primarily run by hydrocarbons? Of course it would have.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has it changed anything out here? It’s not like once you leave Earth there’s suddenly no crime or poverty or injustice right? The Teds still exist, there’s still pirates, The Iron Quadrant is still poor, the Original Coalition is still rich... I guess I’ve never seen technology change people. People change or they don’t wether they’re holding a tangle or a club.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I get a Tangle?</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long have the Teds been doing things like this?</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Teds messing with Earth is one of the worst kept secrets in the Triad.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I don’t think it would come as a surprise to anyone.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do they do this with other planets?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just us.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s curious.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is a little curious, but, another Earthling I met out here was this Australian guy, Australia’s a part of Earth.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kangaroos.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right, that’s where Kangaroos are. He had this theory that’s always stuck in my head. He said that if any group has cultural power, there will be a concerted effort to keep them away from political power. Because a combination of political power and cultural power would be unstoppable... What are we listening to right now?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s Mozart.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. A piece of music written hundreds of years ago on my planet is being played lightyears away. If that’s not cultural dominance I don’t know what is. We’re speaking English right now, from my planet. Because everyone loves our movies and tv and books.</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you somehow added technology and some political power to that, the Teds would be cooked... So they try and keep us as dumb as they can... Terrwyn, how am I doing? Do you feel like I’m talking to you like an adult?</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happened to your arm?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Winnie.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s fine. I was working in core design for a while. One of the drives became unstable and there was an explosion.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did it hurt?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mercifully, I don’t remember it happening, I just woke up in post op.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does it feel like?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It takes some getting used to. It’s better than having no arm but it’s no replacement for the real thing.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I poke you will you feel it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kind of.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we’re bombarding Jeremy with questions. Jeremy, it’s your turn.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Well, Hannes you’re from Septsu I’m assuming.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. Septsu si-hai.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">KatKat you’re from Sigius obviously. And you, with the brand new visor, you’re a Crimson Nyxite.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">One family, three races. What’s going on there?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s an adoption lottery on my planet for couples who aren’t genetically compatible. That’s how we got Terrwyn.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody wants kids from my planet but they adopted me anyway.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terrwyn, don’t say things like that.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true, Jeremy. Nobody wants to deal with a kid who has to wear a red visor everywhere. Frankly I know how they feel right now.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where do you hear these things?</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">One of my study partners told me.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well your study partner is an idiot.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t say that about other kids, Dad.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure I can. Call him right now, I’ll tell him to his face.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t call him, I don’t have a tangle.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a friend from Nyx, she one of the smartest people I’ve ever met.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, her name’s Libuza, she’s a Flaxian Nyxite and she’s a frigging genius. You should tell your friend.</p>
<p class="direction">A CHIME GOES OFF IN THE HOUSE.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh oh. Lunch break is over. Back to school.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t call it school if it’s just my room.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the closest thing we’ve got out here in the Cee-Cees kiddo, get in there.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long are you staying, Jeremy?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not sure yet.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it would be rude of you to leave without saying goodbye.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be sure and say goodbye then.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you. Mom, I’m about to be laughed at by other children because I’m wearing a grain silo on my face, how do you feel about that?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d feel worse about it if I didn’t know you were exaggerating for effect.</p>
<p class="character">TERRWYN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goodbye.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">See you at dinner.</p>
<p class="direction">TERRWYN EXITS TO HER ROOM.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s great.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like Hannes and I are doing a great job, but she has the distinct ability to make it feel like we’re constantly failing her.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take it from me, you guys are doing great. I wanted to leave home so bad I left the planet and the galaxy.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, how does that work, exactly? You can’t really tell mom and dad you’ve gone to space, right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">For me it wasn’t such an issue. Some people on Earth decide to leave society behind and go live in the woods. My parents were those people. My dad hates technology and my mother is literally allergic to it, so it’s not like I’d be able to call them. Last they heard from me I was on a research station on the other side of the planet.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, humans can be allergic to technology?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, no, actually. Some of them think that electromagnetic fields make them sick. There’s no proof that’s true, but that doesn’t stop some Earthlings from feeling that way.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">But, you’re an engineer.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, the things you would make, made your mom sick?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yeah, it wasn’t great. That on top of having a dad who was a pretty big asshole, made leaving pretty easy. So, like I said, you guys are doing a great job.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, well, onto other business. I’m going to open up a bottle of Festen-Lye.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? What’s the special occasion?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re all going to have a glass and you two are going to tell me what the fuck is going on.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hope I haven’t gotten anyone into trouble.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">You haven’t.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be the judge of that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why don’t you tell me what you know and I’ll fill in the rest.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. I know that we had to leave the coalition planets so that Hannes could continue his research. I know that he had an anonymous little helper that up and vanished a while back. I now know that that little anonymous helper is somehow an Earthling.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... And you know what his research is about, I’m assuming?</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">She knows.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. When we first started seeing each other, and he finally confessed to me that his pet project was a doomsday device, I strongly questioned my taste in potential partners.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Understandable.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then he finally convinced me that he was researching it, so that he could prevent it from ever being built.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, the idea was, if we can come up with a viable model for this doomsday device, it meant someone else could too. Which would mean someone needs to come up with a way to defend against it.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our home planets want nothing to do with this research, which is why we had to leave, so I could keep working.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What else would you like to know?</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is actually when she decides she doesn’t want to hear any more about it. Which I get.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He told me you had a cute little name for this thing.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... A Cowcatcher.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh... how does it work?</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re sure you want to know this, Kat?</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sweetie, Jeremy hasn’t shown up because he’s on vacation. You’ve had a breakthrough I’m assuming?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I have.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... how does it work?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Imagine a missile that travels faster than the speed of light. If you’re traveling faster than light, one of your many potential problems is photon collection. You’re now traveling faster than photons, which means some of them may collect on your hull. A Cowcatcher is designed to collect as many photons as possible as it travels faster than light. When a Cowcatcher arrives at it’s target, it doesn’t blow up or anything, it just stops.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">And every single photon it’s collected is suddenly released at the speed of light.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you’ve traveled faster than the speed of light for long enough, when a Cowcatcher stops it could potentially release enough energy to obliterate an entire solar system.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Fuck.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like dropping a supernova in your enemies’ backyard.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Feeling pretty justified in not asking about your work, honey.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... What’s the verdict? Am I going to be staying up nights afraid that we’re suddenly going to atomized?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was hoping at some point your husband and I could compare notes so we could see how much sleep you have to lose.</p>
<p class="character">KATKAT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’m glad I started drinking early.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO HANNES’ STUDY. A DISPLAY HUMS IN FRONT OF THEM AS HE EXPLAINS.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">So here’s the visualization of the warp bubble. As you can see, in the front of the bubble spacetime contracts and at the back of the bubble it expands. The weapon technically stays still, while the warp bubble it’s contained in travels faster than light. The most unexpected thing I found is that, assuming the power source is consistent, acceleration can be infinite.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, so not only would this theoretically go faster than light, it can go several times faster.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">As you might be able to tell, I just took the basic ideas from an inertial dampener and I kept expanding the idea. It was way too unruly at first but If I modify the bubble geometry to make the walls of the bubble thicker it gets much more stable.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE HOLOGRAM CONTRACTING AND THEN CONSISTENTLY HUMMING.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... There it is.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. It’s possible, for sure. And I think with this new bubble construction it’ll require a lot less power. But it will still need a very powerful engine. Something more powerful than anything out there.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that’s where I come in.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">How have things been going on your end?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on, let me connect to my ship’s drive.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Can you imagine if the Teds got a hold of something like this? They could end a rebellion at the drop of a hat with one of these.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They could, but The Teds are just as dependent on the Traid as we are on them. They start blowing up star systems and they’re ending their lifeline of natural resources. Also, they religiously ban any research on faster than light travel since it would be a direct competitor to their warp gates. I don’t worry about the Teds, I worry about bad actors. I worry about pirates, terrorists. Then past that I worry about proliferation. Suddenly we’re living in a world where three galaxies all have a gun pointed at each other.</p>
<p class="direction">THE HOLOGRAM IN FRONT OF THEM CHANGES.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. This is Uncle Rogue. It’s a dark matter engine. A dark matter engine isn’t the kind of power signature we’re looking for but if I keep the basic idea intact but flip it on it’s head, it can harvest dark energy instead of dark matter.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">So the fuel source has negative energy density.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly. So I’ve got my simulation now plugged into your simulation. Let’s see what happens.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF ACTIVATES THE SIMULATION AND THE WHOLE THING COMES TO LIFE.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Holy shit... It works...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Hammer of the fucking gods.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">How fast is it going?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">1.3 Times the speed of light. But watch what happens when I speed up the time line.</p>
<p class="direction">THE HOLOGRAM MOVES FASTER.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">1.4... 1.5, It’s getting faster.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just like you said. Looks like, forgive the Earth metric, but after traveling for a year it’ll be going 5.7 Times faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">And it’ll just keep going.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Until it hits it’s target.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">... This is amazing.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s emitting waves forward.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How can it send anything forward when it’s going faster than anything in the universe?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those are gravity waves. And because of the gravitational distortion...</p>
<p class="character">HANNES</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s sending gravity waves forward in time.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. If you can keep an eye out for this very specific frequency of gravity waves, conceivably you can detect this thing before it’s even launched.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Which, look, it would be great if it didn’t work at all, but at least you can see it coming. If you can see it coming you can figure out how to stop it. But only if people know about it.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>

If there was one particular Sigian involved in the conversation it may have been revealed who it really was that visited your house a while back... So, my name is Leif. If you check the Teds’ top ten most wanted list... actually you won’t find me there because they think I’m dead... I am dead... but also not... it’s complicated... Full disclosure, Hannes... I built it. There is currently a fully operational Cow Catcher attached to the hull of my ship right now and it’s almost at full fuel enrichment... And yes I am going to fire it... But my target isn’t in the Triad... it’s much farther away... It’s headed toward Cryptessia. A place called The Egg. Ask a pirate, they’ll tell you all about it. I’ll launch it in just a few minutes, it will travel up out of the system and head towards Cryptessia. It’ll reach the speed of light within the first day of travel. After that it will increase it’s speed for years. By my estimation it’ll take about six and a half earth years to get there. By the time it reaches it’s target... it will be going faster than maybe anything in the universe has ever traveled... Pretty amazing accomplishment... Too bad it’s a weapon... I’m not going to attempt to tell you why I’m doing this... you’re going to have to trust me... yes I realize how laughable that is... you’ve got a great family, Hannes...

<p class="dialogue">His foot too?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Arm and foot, but it’s curious, I have no idea where they came from. I can’t identify the manufacturer or the technology, they’re more elegant than anything available in the Triad.</p>

Who is this person?”... I ignore it at first, not sure what to do. And my life is complicated, I don’t have time for mysteries, so I get on with things and it sits there in my inbox for a very long time... And then one day news breaks across The Triad, something called Midnight Burger, criss-crossing the Triad, riling up the locals... And there you are... “This is also not the man I knew,” I said... It wasn’t the man in the message it wasn’t the man... Who am I talking to?</p>
