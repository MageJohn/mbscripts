<p class="dialogue">
  Once upon a time, there was a rag doll. Assembled from scraps, stuffed full of
  cotton, a lovely smile made of stitches. No one told the rag doll she was made
  of bits and pieces, but how could she ever know. How could any of us?
</p>
<p class="direction">FIONA AND PETER WALK INTO THE DINING AREA.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  ... I have no idea how any of this works... What do I do?... I should get some
  sleep I guess... yeah, that’s not going to happen...
</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>

  The rag doll, once happily in place with all the toys, had been cast aside and
  was now all alone in the world.

<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Okay... Okay, I used to open the coffee shop all the time. I guess I just...
  I’ll just do that. Right? That’s a good place to start... Peter, let’s give
  you a job. Hang on... See, Peter, this is what humans do, when they’re scared
  out of their minds they just start doing things... When my Grandfather died, I
  went into the kitchen at four AM and my mom was doing the dishes. By hand. We
  had a really nice dishwasher... “I really need to do these right now,” she
  said... Of course that wasn’t really my mother and I have no idea if that
  memory actually happened or was just put in my head... useful story anyway, I
  guess. Okay. Peter. Current mode?

<p class="dialogue">Current mode: Shadow.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>

  Oh!... Peter, do you have a tiny robot voice? I don’t remember that.

<p class="character">FIONA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. “Dear Fiona, I added a little robot voice to Peter.</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  He can’t recite Shakespeare or anything but, trust me, it helps on long hauls
  to have a machine that talks to you.” Okay. That’s nice. Uh... Peter: start
  chronometer.
</p>
<p class="character">P3T3R</p>
<p class="dialogue">Chronometer on.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  I wonder what that’s going to do... Ooh, here we go, Peter: Side work.
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
  Alone in the world, the rag doll knew not what to do. With no one to play with
  her and surround her with plastic walls and tiny tea sets, the rag doll was
  faced with something she thought impossible: acting like a real girl.

  WE MOVE TO THE NEXT DAY. OUTSIDE THE DINER IT IS A NICE QUIET DAY. FIONA AND
  PETER WALK OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT.

<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  This is good for a first shift. Very chill. I was worried we were going to get
  a mad rush, I don’t even know how to use the kitchen yet... This is a nice
  planet, I wonder where we are...
</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Oh shit, someone’s coming, don’t freak out, Peter... Hello. Welcome to
  Midnight Burger.

<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>

<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m sorry? You know Caspar?</p>

  Yes, I’m used to dealing with Caspar. Can I speak with Caspar?

<p class="dialogue">I’m Fiona. This is Peter.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Alright, well there’s no time for explanations, have you done this before,
  Fiona?
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Done what, exactly?</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh dear. You have no idea what’s going on, do you?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t, I’m very confused.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well. Inside, if you don’t mind.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>

<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  My name is Dr. Caberant. I am the designated magistrate for the day of
  joining.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Day of Joining.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Is this your first time on this planet?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Probably?</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Wonderful. This planet is called Thegrion. Ring any bells?
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Well, we haven’t much time. This is Joining Day on our planet. It’s a solemn
  day of remembrance, alright?
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where is the clock again?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Up here.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Yes. Right. When the hand that is on the six moves to the seven, we will have
  several delegates from around the planet arrive. We’ll drink some of the
  ceremonial coffee and we will eat the ceremonial Luncheon. Please tell me you
  can handle the ceremonial coffee and luncheon.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Definitely the coffee.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wonderful. May I have some now?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  I enjoy it with the white substance. And the other thing?
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cream and sugar?</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s it, thank you.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Coming right up.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  It’s looking very clean, so at least there’s that, Fiona.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  It was my one constant complaint to Caspar, a complaint that was never
  improved upon, sadly.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, you know Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I’ve worked with Caspar many times in the past.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... how?</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  ... Fiona, I don’t like to mince words, I’m sure you’ve noticed.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  They really need to train the new people more thoroughly.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Agreed.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  From the beginning: This is Thegrion. Every year at the same time, the diner
  appears here on Thegrion.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Yes. It’s on this day that we mark a solemn occasion, we all drink of the
  ceremonial coffee and eat the ceremonial luncheon.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Luncheon. Right.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What will we be having for the ceremonial luncheon?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona that hand is moving very quickly to the seven.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you usually have?</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Historically it’s been whatever Caspar could muster at the time. We did this
  for years and he never seemed to improve all that much in the luncheon
  department. In truth, it doesn’t really matter, the food is a ritualistic part
  of the ceremony, it can be anything.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, I make a really great grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright, do I need to know what that is?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s great.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  That will work, then. And the sticks that accompany them?
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">French fries?</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, that’s it. We’ll have those?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure, sure, I’ll figure it out.</p>
<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>
<p class="dialogue">
  Excellent. It’s going to go just fine Fiona. Remember, we don’t have food like
  this on our planet so the bar is quite low, Caspar has always benefitted from
  that.
</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love that.</p>

  Pretending to be a real girl seemed simple enough. No one seemed to notice as
  long as they didn't look too closely. She would smile, laugh when she needed
  to, even though she didn't understand the joke. Pretending to be a real girl
  did not make her feel less alone, but the rag doll was not without friends

  It is! We’re a musical people, we Thegronis. Every child gets one of these on

<p class="character">DR. CABERANT</p>

  Yes. That’s how it all began for us. You see, we were suffering from a
  terrible plague about a thousand years ago. We could find no cure for it and
  were nearly wiped off the face of the planet. We were reduced to small,
  isolated communities around the globe. A couple of generations later, we had
  developed an immunity to the disease, but the isolation and suspicion had now
  become engrained in our culture. Then, one day a man named Monad Nik found the
  diner, walked inside, and there was Marissa. Now, they didn’t speak the same
  language, so it was a bit difficult, but Marissa was a practitioner in a
  sacred art known as ESL. Year after year, Marissa would return and teach
  Monad-Nik more of her language and gave him sacred texts to learn while she
  was away. Monad Nik began to teach this language to others, and, long story
  short, that’s what we needed to come back together as a society: A common
  language that didn’t belong to any community.

  Sourcer ID 5850-Trinary... As a general overview of my time here, I am of two
  minds. Since my arrival at my terminus mission, I have been able to document
  an outsized amount of technologies, both for archival and advancement
  purposes. Far more than if I were to conduct missions in a traditional format.
  As directed, I have transmitted my findings when in an environment where
  networks are available. This work has been extremely satisfying. However there
  is an overarching project that I have self-assigned, and this project’s
  completion has proven to be elusive... We have been here before. What is Urt’s
  relationship to this anomalous craft? Additionally, is this a craft?
  Additionally, is this technology?... If I am correct in my assessment of a
  previous Urt presence at this location, I am requesting all pertinent records.
  End dictation.

  I hear you... I did test flight training on an f-104. Real fast plane. I took
  it over Mach 2... One time I was in an adventurous mood and I took it all the
  way up top. Thirty thousand meters. I flipped it, and looked down at the
  earth... like touching the hand of God. For me that was a transformation. I
  was a new man when my wheels were down on the ground... And for someone else,
  they would’ve shit their pants, passed out, and swore to never get into a
  plane again... Your heaven is somebody’s hell, no matter how great it may feel
  to you.

  No, there’s no cure for something like that. She’ll be alright though. All
