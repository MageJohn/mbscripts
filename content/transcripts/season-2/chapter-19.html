<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d you know about the Purple Nullifier?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s two doomsday devices?</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I swear to God the words “Just a bomb” came out of your mouth. How does that feel?</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No shop talk. What is the Ted Slayer?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously, you called it the Ted Slayer?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that’s what it does.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a computer virus, it unravels the Ted Empire from the inside out.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But we talked about it a lot and we decided that we shouldn’t use it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You shouldn’t use it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I need you to focus on this next question very carefully: What?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s awful nice to have everyone back together again, isn’t it dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Its real nice, Husband.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The negatives outweigh the positives.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How heavy are these negatives exactly?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mass starvation. Plague.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, that sounds bad, but there’s a very big ship floating outside, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can see the ship.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the size of Sri Lanka, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And let me tell you about this thing, you may have heard of it, it’s called chemical ice.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve heard of it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, you’re a criminal, have you ever been frozen in Chemical Ice?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Twice.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Twice!</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Six times.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Six times over there. Would we recommend being frozen in chemical ice?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not great.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we’re all on the brink of being frozen in chemical ice and we have the thing that can stop that but we’re not using it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would like to fill out a comment card, please.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wouldn’t just fuck the Teds, Caspar it would fuck everybody. If the warp gates shut down, everybody suffers. We talked about it, we argued about it, this is what we decided.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">… Okay.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Okay, if that’s the way it is, then okay. We’ll figure something else out.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the radio.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Leif. Look at all the cannons I’m firing right now. I think it’s all-… is it all the cannons?… Yeah, it’s all of them, isn’t it crazy?… Leif? Leif are you there? C’mon don’t be like that, it’s your old pal Låfftrax.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have invited exactly zero people into this radio with us.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">All of a sudden it’s like the town hall.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, please talk to the Space Pirate.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Låfftrax, I’m not giving you the Ted Slayer.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure? It kinda feels like you’re gonna give it to me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you are though.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody is getting it, Låfftrax.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me do some math. I want the boom boom device. I’m the only thing standing between you and the Teds turning you into a popsicle. Sounds like I get whatever I want right now.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to watch you plunge three galaxies into chaos, Låfftrax.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay but counterpoint: I’m going to kill all your friends.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Minsky already tried that, it didn’t work.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Let’s get him in here, guys where’s Minsky?… Oh, I killed him? Apparently I killed him. How did I kill him?… Meat grinder? Wow. I guess I threw him in the meat grinder… Did I kill him first and throw him in there? No? Just shoved him in there alive, huh? Damn. Dark, guys. Dark. Okay, never mind on that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Låfftrax, listen. I’m not giving you the Ted Slayer, but if you can get us out of this jam I will come back and work for you.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You most certainly will not.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, what the fuck?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need some way out of this.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I don’t know what a pirate is but I’m pretty sure I don’t want you to be one.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do not approve this plan.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon does not approve this plan, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, absolutely not.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Am I the only one who knows how fucked we are right now? Two ships out there. Both of them filled with the worst of The Triad. One ship wants to kill us, the other one will if we don’t meet it’s demands. This is the most fucked we’ve ever been.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I’ve read many a pirate story in my youth and I feel as though these pirates are not the sort to go adventuring for buried treasure.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">All while adorned with a colorful bird of some kind.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">They appear to have eliminated those delightful aspects.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But kept all of the killin’.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even Older Leif can you talk some sense into him please?</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d give it a shot, Gloria, but I’m not getting through to him. See, the young man has himself a little theory, don’t you, Buster?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is he talking about?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">… I think I’m the reason that The Teds know about the diner.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Way back when, right before I came here. I had just quit working for Låfftrax.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think The Teds were following me, hoping that I would lead them back to Låfftrax. All the pirates in the system were looking for me. I was on the run.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then suddenly there was a diner.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes… I think the Teds were watching me the first time I ever walked in here. Which means they saw the diner disappear and I’m sure it all started from there. Guys all of this could be my fault. All of it. It makes me sick to think I’ve gotten you all into this mess… I wanted to be someone else, so when I got here I just started acting like the guy that I wanted to be. But I guess that’s just not how things work.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the radio.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I’m back. Hey, just caught the tail end of that. Wanted to jump in here real quick guys. Leif is totally right. We know about the diner because of him. He’s the only reason it’s even a thing for us. That’s a pretty big ouch, Leif. Does it burn?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, it’s fine. I’ve worked for Låfftrax before, I can do it again. At least with the pirates I won’t have to act like someone I’m not. I guess that’s all I was doing around here anyway.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, we are not letting you go.</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doesn’t matter, Effie. Låfftrax isn’t going to go for it anyway.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, Leif, I’ve decided, no.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, Honeybear, I miss the crap out of you. We had a lot of fun. Remember that time you flooded an entire city?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamn it.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">I remember that. Wiped out several neighborhoods just to rob a bank. What a guy!</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good times all around. But the thing is, I’m really excited about all this chaos I’m going to create when you give me the boom boom box, it’s really going to elevate my piracy game.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is this box again?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey! I’m talking here! Y’know what? Y’know what I’m going to do? Remember that beamy-downy thing you told me not to buy because it was too dangerous? Well… oops, I bought it! I’m going to beam down there.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, don’t do that.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really excited to meet your new friends.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Låfftrax!</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, man. This is perfect. Literally every criminal I want to capture is about to be in the same place. Did I win a sweepstakes? Do you guys have a comically large check for me?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright, everybody over to Ava’s booth, I’m sick of shithead listening to us.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sir. I do not appreciate you speaking out of our radio, We consider it a violation.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no. A violation? How many demerits?</p>

<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah? What have you got for me? Locusts? Frogs? None of those work in space, you hayseeds.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh we’re going to come up with something, just you wait.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, sorry, you’re not going to be able to loaves and fishes your way out of this problem.</p>
<p class="direction">BEEPING</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is BertBert broadcasting on The Undersignal. I am currently onboard Midnight Burger on the outer rim of Triangulum. We appear to be caught in a naval battle between a Ted Battle cruiser and the dreaded Alex P Keaton, the flagship of the pirate Låfftrax. Despite our precarious situation, the true danger lies beyond us. For as long this reporter can remember The Ted Empire has denied conducting experiments with time crystals, the same objects responsible for the implosion and destruction of Vapus 10 in Andromeda. Vapian refugees still to this day recall with horror the destruction of their planet from the volatile time crystals and science councils across The Triad have banned their use. Despite all that, here I stand looking upon a gargantuan construction that is allegedly fueled by these dangerous objects.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">… So, what do pirates like to eat?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, this is good, actually. When the space pirate gets here I can threaten them, y’know, physically.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, quick update, guys, Ex is actually incredibly powerful to the point that it’s fucking terrifying but none of that matters.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. What are you going to do? Kill Låfftrax?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but they don’t know that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re just going to call your bluff. If you killed Låfftrax then the pirate ship and the Ted ship would want to kill us.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Being powerful should be more fun.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we need to start getting in a headspace where can give the doomsday device to the Space Pirate, guys.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Every ounce of crime in the Triad goes through Låfftrax, they’re the only thing more terrifying than The Teds.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Never been sure exactly.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seems to me it’s pretty clear, Jasper. Låfftrax wants box. Leif gives Låfftrax box.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I understand that but unfortunately you’ve created a situation where it’s in our best interests to not give you the box.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve what now?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">If we give you the box then you leave, right?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">True.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if you leave then there’s no one to stop the Teds from coming to get us.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m listening.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So then we can’t give you the box because you’re the only person keeping us alive. And you can’t threaten it out of us because you tried that already? Is that correct?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You tried that already.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s wrong with right now. Exactly. Right now is great! I mean, not for any of you, you’re probably all screwed but for me it’s great! What’s the point of going back in time to try and patch things up with your girlfriend?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not… she wasn’t my girlfriend.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Nope.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that might work actually.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you hear what I just said?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Låfftrax isn’t going to go for it, they’ve been obsessed with the Ted Slayer ever since I left.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course they are, plunging three galaxies into total chaos, that’s like Space Pirate Coachella.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">No. But you’re going to have one.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah? This sounds like a waste of time, I’m into it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just to make sure we’re on the same page, if someone uses this device then the entire Ted Empire unravels.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds great right?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It really does, but then also, when the Teds unravel, so does The Triad, right?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Three galaxies full of chaos.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just talking about it gets me excited.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I don’t think you want that.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. See, there was this guy on Earth. His name was Al Capone.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was a murderous psychopath who was riddled with syphilis.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh. Swipe right.</p>
<p class="direction">LAUGHTER.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He became incredibly powerful when America decided that it would be a great idea to ban alcohol. Did that stop people from drinking? No. All it did was create a lot of work for people who were good at skirting the law. With alcohol being illegal, Al Capone was able to create a criminal empire larger than anything anyone had ever seen.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You watch a lot of history shows right?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true. See, Al Capone was only able to become Al Capone because he had laws to break.</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you use this doomsday device then you win. No more Teds. You’d be the ruler of the triad.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love this story.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you going to do with all the starving people?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean what am I going to do?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Teds are pretty smart, Låfftrax. They suck, they’re the worst, everybody hates them. But they’ve insinuated themselves into peoples lives so deeply, that people can no longer function without them. So now, the way anyone feels about them is totally pointless. People are forced to just sit there and take it, because they have no other choice.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">And this is an argument AGAINST destroying them?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is. Because I say again, what are you going to do with all the starving people?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">The fuck do I care?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let ‘em starve, right?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there you are, you’re they ruler of an empire where everyone is dying. Does that sound like any fun to you?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what I’m talking about.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, fine. Uh... I turn on the warp gate for the planets that have the food and I let them sell it to me for a jacked up price. Now if you want to eat, you go through me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. Let’s look at one of those planets as an example.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is boring.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stick with me. What’s that planet with all the fields?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Menite?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Menite! A planet full of rolling fields of grain. Planet gluten, we used to call it. You turn on their warp gate so they can get you all the grain you want and then you turn around and sell it for, I’m thinking, a 500% price increase. In an effort to provide you with all the food that you demand, now everybody on Menite is a farmer. And when everybody’s a farmer, nobody does anything else. When people get sick there’s no doctors, when children are born, they’re born idiots because there are no more schools because everyone is out in the fields all day. You have now created a planet full of sick idiots in charge of feeding millions. When their machines break down, nobody can fix them, when plagues hit, there’s no one to heal them.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine, I’ll put some schools there or whatever and I’ll send them some doctors.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. Fantastic. Are you hiring the teachers?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Best to delegate. Ooof, that’s a big planet though, you’re going to need a lot of teachers and those teachers are going to need some organizational support so you’re going to have to create some sort of department of education. You’re cool with that, right?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lot of people to take care of too. I mean we’re not talking about a handful of doctors we’re talking about thousands.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m assuming you’re not going to hire them either which means you’ll have to delegate the responsibility of hiring the farmers, the doctors, and the teachers. But you know what? Who hires the person that hires the doctors and the teachers, is that you?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still no.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, then there’s going to need to be someone above the teachers and the doctors and the people who hire the teachers and the doctors.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who the hell is that guy?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m thinking a prime minister. Someone to be in charge of the whole planet, someone who answers directly to you.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. There, it’s handled.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">One problem.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">One, huh?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You see, what you don’t know is that on Menite, there’s a small faction of isolationists. They hated the Teds when they were in charge and now they hate you too. They work against you in the background, trying to convince people that you, a murderous Space Pirate, have no business taking the fruits of their hard work and leaving them with nothing. They hold late night meetings, then protests, then walkouts, then they are burning straw effigies if you in the town square! What do they call themselves, Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Brotherhood of the Scythe.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Brotherhood of the Scythe. I think we can both agree that a name like that is a marketing slam dunk, can’t we?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I have them killed.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How? You can’t find them. You don’t know anyone on this planet, they all look the same to you. You really want to spend your time rooting out rebellion on the wheat fields?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then what do you do, Låfftrax?</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">… Form a police force.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. Låfftrax the Pirate, career criminal, is hiring cops.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I don’t want to hire cops.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody does! But you don’t have a choice because there are people out there starving, and nobody wants to rule over a starving empire.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. I’ll hire some cops.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Unfortunately they’ve just formed a union.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Already?!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes. Because they’re risking their lives every day and they feel that they deserve more pay than your giving them. Uh-oh, the teachers just found out about the police union. Now they’re unionizing too. They insist that they’re job is as important as the police.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
