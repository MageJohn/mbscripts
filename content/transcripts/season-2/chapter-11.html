<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what?… So what, they’ll look at me weird, so what? We’re used to it, right?… I’m trying to retrace my steps, I was standing here, I put the batteries in the radio and there it was, then I get home and nothing. But here we are again and still nothing… No, I’m remembering it right. The dial was right there, halfway between AM 1070 and AM 1080… HA! Very funny. No, look, my brain definitely needs to be recalled to the factory for a repair but I can still depend on it for a few things. This is one. So I’m going to… I’m going to sit right here next to this streetlight and have faith in what my brain tells me… radio signals are funny. Sometimes the wind blows them away, sometimes they end up ten miles further from where they’re supposed to be. Sometimes they’re strong, sometimes their weak. My uncle said he had so many fillings in his teeth that sometimes he picked up a station in Texas that played Tejano music. He’d be tapping his feet sometimes out of nowhere, and he’d say “I can’t help it, they’re playing Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.”… Y’know the Selena song… Yeah, yeah that’s it… Why do I always think of something I need as soon as I sit down? That’s not just me that does that right? If I’m going to sit here a while I’m going to need a Dr. Pepper and probably something else that’s not good for me. Okay, I’m going. I’d ask you if you want anything but you don’t exist, so…</p>

<p class="dialogue">Look. I swear to god this money is real, I know it doesn’t look right but you’ve got to trust me. I… I work for the Department of the Treasury and when we get paid we get the new stuff, okay? The stuff that’s not out yet, it’s one of the perks of serving our nation… You’re just going to stare at me, that’s how this is going to work?</p>

<p class="character">DRU: (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, lookie. There’s our new friend smoking and drinking vodka in the parking lot in front of God and everybody… What’s her deal, you think?… No, no you’re just making assumptions, surely a grown woman can drink and smoke in the parking lot without being considered a floozie. And I’m sorry, “floozie” is that even a word anymore?… I’m going to talk to her… Why? Well, because I should probably spend the day interacting with someone other than a gas n’ sip employee who hates me and someone I made up in my head, that’s why. You know what Joseph Campbell would call this? The call to adventure. Isn’t that nice?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Ava, I would be more disturbed by your behavior if it wasn’t the most entertaining thing that’s happened to me in two years.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happened two years ago?</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">A truck full of Maker’s Mark jackknifed on the state road and by the time the police got there, all the Maker’s Mark was gone.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s hilarious.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">That night was one of the wildest nights in the history of Rogers, Arkansas. Turns out you can’t be arrested for drunk driving when everyone else in town is also drunk driving, including the sheriff.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Glad I could liven things up for you, hey, what’s with the radio?</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I was looking for a station. I can’t find it at home so I thought I’d try where I first heard it.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t actually know. But hey, have you been to the new diner around the corner?</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Around the corner?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was headed there right now. They get it loud and clear.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I live around the corner, there’s no diner around the corner.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just came from there. And I’M the crazy one? Look, I’ve got work to do so I’m heading back there. You should come by.</p>

<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guess I’m crazy then.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">… Do you remember a diner around the corner?… Me neither, what the heck is she talking about?… We would’ve noticed a diner, right? We’re not that far gone are we? Heh. She said to her imaginary friend… Yes I know we could just walk around the corner and check… Problem with that is if I walk around the corner and there’s not a diner then we just had a nice little encounter with a nut, but if there’s a diner there and I didn’t even know it, well what does that say about me?… yes I know what that says about me, you know what? To hell with it. here we go.</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL AND THEN ON CONCRETE.</p>
<p class="character">DRU: (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m thinking of a time in high school when I was smoking behind the football field, because that’s what cool people do. And from around the corner I started to hear someone say “Are you my baby? Are you my baby girl?” Over and over again, “Are you my baby? Are you my baby girl?” And I was terrified. Because I thought I was in a horror movie all of a sudden. Because, as you know, if you’re about to get killed in a horror movie it’s right after you do something naughty or illegal. And there I was having just smoked a cigarette at the age of fifteen. But I couldn’t help myself, I had to see what was happening around the corner. “Are you my baby? Are you my baby girl?” You know what it was? A parrot. Someone’s pet parrot had escaped and was sitting on a phone line saying the same line over and over again. I had scared myself for nothing.</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: FOOTSTEPS STOP.</p>
<p class="character">DRU: (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not a parrot. That’s a diner. What in the world? Was this… Was this here before? No. There’s just no way… Yeah, I know I said “call to adventure” but is that usually in the form of a diner that you never noticed before?… Well, here’s the problem with that, NOW it’s actually good news if this diner was here the whole time and I never noticed because if it wasn’t here the entire time then a diner has popped over night and diners don’t do that… Yes, it means we have to go in… So… Here we go.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Deep through the midcourse of morning Is shadowed the base of the mountain; Under the wings of the stormcloud. Only the top peak takes light.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would climb up against shadow, Leaving the lost past behind me; I would move up through the darkness, Breasting each crag till it pass.</p>

I mention it now because there was one day when I met a man from Colorado, who dwelled at the base of the great Rocky Mountains, and to him my little mountain may as well have been a pile of leaves in his backyard. A mere one-thousand feet up. But you see, when he stood atop my tiny mountain, it was not his home that he looked upon and for me it was. A thing must be known to be appreciated.</p>

Of course, as always, the names were changed for the panel and if you are interested in participating in our next Area 51 panel do leave us a message on the hotline, always interesting stuff there. Okay, coming up soon we’ve got Dr. Sim Samba, really interesting guy, just published a new book on a fascinating study he’s done. According to Dr. Samba we can know the complex thoughts of babies and toddlers by recording the sounds they make and then playing them in reverse. Really interesting stuff, I was listening to some of the recordings before the show and it is hard to argue with this theory, we’ve got a lot to talk about. But before that we’re going to take some calls. Okay, Grand Prairie, Texas, help me out with this name, ma’am.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s a very pretty way of putting it.</p>

<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s that?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Friend of Ava’s. But look, none of that matters, you know why?</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you’ve gone crazy and this is a hallucination, right? You’ve lost your mind and none of this is real.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I say we go inside and keep this crazy train a-rollin’. What do you say?</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aw, to hell with it. Let’s go.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, Ava. What am I doing with this magnet?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re going to make contact!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, how?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re going to play kick the can!</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, what now?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hear me out. On Dru’s table is this aluminum napkin holder.</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: AVA TAPPING THE NAPKIN HOLDER.</p>
<p class="character">AVA: (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I want you to fire up the electro-magnet and zap the napkin holder across the room.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that going to do?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re tying to make contact with another dimension. It’s different from us. The way two different things make contact is through things they have in common. So we’re going to try basic primordial forces like gravity or magnetism.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Since Leif can’t whip up a gravity cannon, we’re going with magnetism.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who says I can’t whip up a gravity cannon?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif zaps the napkin holder across the room and we HOPE that in HIS dimension, there is ALSO a napkin holder and Lief’s magnet, being incredibly strong, pulls his napkin holder across the room AS WELL.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">So in his dimension, he’s just sitting there and his napkin holder goes flying across the room.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then what?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then we wait.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">For what?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Us.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">We wait for us?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Because in all likelihood in his dimension there is also a Gloria and a Leif and an Ava. Then they have to figure out the next move.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s literally kick the can.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s literally kick the can.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Y’all know that kick the can isn’t just kicking a can around, right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s make a magnet. Dru, as you can see here I’ve got a big battery, some insulated cables and a wrench. Believe it or not, I’m going to turn this into a magnet.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking “Hey, if this is going to be a powerful magnet, why doesn’t it have one of those huge comical U shapes like when Wile E Coyote is trying to catch the Road Runner?”</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cause it’s an electro magnet, Leif. I made one in the 5th grade science fair.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cool, how strong was it?</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">It could pick up a whole handful of paper clips.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>
<p class="dialogue">This one can take out your fillings.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ow.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, Ava you just want me to fire this up and knock the napkin holder off the table, is that the deal?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, just enough to get his attention in the other dimension.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF:</p>

<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">It did?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah, he’s up and walking around. He’s talking to people. I guess he’s talking to us in the other dimension.</p>

<p class="dialogue">So now we just wait for another version of us to figure it out?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. It may take a while.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What do you think I look like in the other dimension? Do you think I have a goatee?</p>

<p class="dialogue">No. I for sure have one though.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Since it’s going to be a while, why don’t we all watch while Leif cleans up the mess he’s made?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, we can’t touch anything. We have to wait for them.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait for them to what?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Move something around.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">With what?</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hopefully the Ava in the other dimension is going to tell the Leif in the other dimension to make a magnet that will move OUR napkin holders around.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Alright, Leif go over to Ava’s booth and you two make sure this plan isn’t idiotic. I’m going to see if this steamer works. Who wants tamales?</p>

<p class="dialogue">You’ve faired much better than some of our other visitors. Some of them have simply run screaming and never returned.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t blame them.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE:</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m glad you’re speaking with us, Drucilla. I have a sense that this mystery figure in our diner is not simply a stranger.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, he’s not. Um…</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Worry not, Drucilla, what can sound outlandish at this juncture?</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Suppose you’re right. It’s my brother. I lost him when he was six but that’s him for sure. All grown up.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, bless your heart.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">My little eight-year old self went through some things trying to get used to him being gone. I don’t know how to feel about seeing the ghost of him just across the room. I just… is that okay? When people are gone we should respect that shouldn’t we? Try to come to terms with it best we can? It’s feeling a little… I don’t know, unnatural?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Drucilla, I imagine this whole day has felt a bit unnatural.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I am talking to a radio.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE:</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know how you must feel. It’s certainly akin to how my husband and I have felt from time to time. But you see, we were born a long time ago, Drucilla. Back when we were your age, Arkansas wasn’t much more than an idea and some lines on a map. Just a mess of farmers and ne’er-do-wells. But through time spent with our friends we’ve ruminated often on this idea of what is natural and what is not. Even when contemplating ourselves. What they have told you is that every moment of our loved ones lives echoes forever in the firmament. They have told you that everything our friends and family were, weren’t, and could have been is alive with us at this moment. Forever. And that may seem strange and unnatural, but my husband and I have a very natural word for it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eternal life.</p>
<p class="character">DRU:</p>
<p class="dialogue">How come when I go to church it’s not as interesting as y’all?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE:</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, tamales.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, if you don’t mind could we all partake of your tamales here at the counter? I have some things I’d like to say.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure. Up here, guys.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>

<p class="dialogue">What’s up, Zebulon?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON:</p>
<p class="dialogue">As you know, I find meaning in all things. Here we are now with Drucilla, who for the first time will reach out to one she’s lost. She will attempt to say what has not been said to a loved one.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, jeez, I can see this coming from a mile away.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON:</p>
<p class="dialogue">And though you may mock me, I think it important that we now address who we have lost. We lost a friend a while back and we have yet to truly address it to each other and to ourselves.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zeb, we don’t have to do this-</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON:</p>
<p class="dialogue">One day rolls into another in this place. Every day, somewhere new, a new problem to solve, it is easy to lose oneself in it. We know that Caspar surely did. As Drucilla is now presented with the opportunity to impart words to one whom she thought departed, we should now impart something to our departed.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Seriously.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE:</p>
