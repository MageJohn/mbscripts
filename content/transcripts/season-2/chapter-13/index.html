<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So… where are we headed?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you’re taking me somewhere to kill me, the void of space is right outside, we could take care of this right now.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to kill you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay… What are you going to do?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooookay… You know, you were not on the list of people that I thought might rescue me.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who was on the list?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, there wasn’t even a list.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well… Surprise.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You had a name for me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We did. The Ex.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">The universal embodiment of all exes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s silly. I’m not that, you know?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you, then?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what I am. I know what I was. I was an object. Created with a purpose.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which was?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">To find you and confront you about leaving your wife.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re an android who can travel through space, time, and dimensions. And your sole purpose is to confront me about leaving my wife?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why in the world would someone create you?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’d have to ask your wife. She made me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">My wife made you?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">My wife was an accountant.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">In your native timeline your wife was a CPA. In my native timeline your wife was the most brilliant scientist Earth had ever seen. She changed the planet with her ideas. Saved it from destruction.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t sound like her.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Privately she was obsessed with you. Specifically how she was able to save an entire planet, but not a marriage.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds more like her.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You had disappeared. So she created me to find you, confront you about leaving her, and then report back. But in her rage she made me incredibly powerful and was not specific enough with her directives, so to complete my task I had to confront every iteration of you in every timeline before I could return to her.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a lot of mes.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s infinite yous, Caspar. It’s an impossible task, but I would’ve continued until I ceased to function. It was your friends who finally stopped me. That was nice of them.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many mes had you confronted before you got to me?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eleven-million, three-hundred and eighty-six thousand, three-hundred and ninety-one.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God!</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a lot.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s too many mes.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you know what? Every version of you was miserable. I was amazed by the consistency of their misery in the timeline. Your misery may be the most consistent thing in the multiverse.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s on-brand. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s okay. I’m free now.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t even imagine.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were also a woman in a high percentage of timelines. Also one time a lion fish, it was funny.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds like a nightmare.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s alright. I’m an android, Caspar, I don’t feel things the way you do.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then we just left you there.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">In Kentucky.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">In 1934.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You may not be surprised to hear that when the residents of 1934 Harlan County, Kentucky encounter an unconscious artificial woman they have a negative reaction to it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, God. What did they do?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">They threw me in a river. Brownies Creek, they called it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">They threw you in the river?!</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, it was quite nice. Peaceful. I sunk to the bottom but it wasn’t that deep so you could still see the sun rise and set as the days went by.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Days?!</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">As the years went by, Caspar. The fishing boats that passed over me slowly became motorized, churning the water. I watched them build a bridge over me. Hammering and digging. In the middle of the day the workers would dangle their feet just above me and talk about the world. They talked about a war and the surprising progress that followed and about how the land they were born in was quickly becoming foreign to them. They would toss pebbles in the river and they would land around my body. One night they came to the bridge to drink and fight and talk about sports. They tossed their cans in the river and I watched them float away. One of them got very drunk and swore that when he looked in the river, he could see me. They all called him crazy. When they finished their bridge I was alone again. A year of complete silence. Then one day I saw two yellow eyes peering at me from within the murky water. Something covered in armor that had frightening jaws. They called it a snapping turtle. It hid in the rocks near me. My body reflected light and attracted fish, and it would wait in the darkness and snap at them when they approached. It was obviously there for the fish, but I liked to imagine that it was protecting me as I lay there paralyzed. It was my first friend. While the moss slowly covered my body I began to rebuild my central processor from the beginning. It’s difficult for a thing to fix itself, there were many failures. When I finally emerged from the creek, covered in mud and moss, tree roots wrapped around me, it was 1963. I didn’t have much of my previous programming left, but I still had the ability to find you, my last target. I peered forward in this timeline and saw that you were a prisoner. So I leapt forward in time, stole a ship and broke you out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You laid at the bottom of a creek for thirty years?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Most people would emerge from that creek hating me.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not a person.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well… thank you for rescuing me.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re welcome.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what now?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s up to you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need your help. In exchange for your help I’ll take you anywhere you want to go. Knowing you, that will either be: go back home or find the diner. It’s up to you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You couldn’t have shown up before I was kidnapped?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I could’ve. But a prison break sounded fun.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You let me go through all of that because a prison break sounded fun?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t get to choose the way you’re saved, Caspar, where’s the poetry in that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then take me back to before I was kidnapped.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, for two reasons. One, when I travel through space and time I can’t take anyone with me, and two, for some reason, when I arrived in your current time, my powers were halted. I can no longer travel temporally, I don’t know why.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. The wind chimes.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Teds. They built some sort of thing that’s trapping the diner here. No more time travel. I guess that applies to you too.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And since they’re after the diner, we should try and find them before The Teds do, so it looks like I’m not going home.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You weren’t going to go home anyway.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I’ve been inside your head Caspar. There’s very little I don’t know about you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fantastic. You said you needed my help, what could I possibly help you with?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re going to help me become human.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds like fairy godmother territory, I don’t know about that.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not magically transform me. You’re going to help me understand humanity so I can… be it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You seem pretty human to me aside from the indestructible time traveler part.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I appreciate that, but that’s because I constructed this persona. I’ve been inside the minds of millions of people and I created myself based on all of them. When I laugh it’s someone else’s laugh. My smile is borrowed. None of it is me. It’s funny, when you don’t know who you are, it works out really well for other people. You can just be whoever they want you to be… (Starts speaking in Ava’s voice.) Isn’t there someone else you’d rather be talking to right now? C’mon, Caspar, don’t you want to argue with me? Yell at me for ruining everything? Justify the things you’ve done? what else would you like to do with me?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop doing that.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Speaking in her voice again.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry. my point is, I can be whatever you want me to be, or whatever you don’t want me to be. but what is “me”?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve been inside the minds of millions of people and don’t know what it is to be human?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Being inside someone’s head isn’t the font of information you think it is. Every human is an ocean of subjectivity. You believe, when you see the world, that you’re getting information. But what a human does is take in information and then tell itself a story. A shepherd stands in a field at night and looks at the night sky. He sees a falling star streak across the horizon and then disappear. But he doesn’t know what a shooting star is, so he tells himself a story about gods falling from the sky. You’re amazing storytellers, especially the stories you tell yourselves. But it’s not truth. It’s all a fiction on some level. That’s why I’m here with you. I need to learn how to tell the story of myself.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s a fascinating sentiment but I’m not sure I’m a good candidate for figuring all that out.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re the perfect candidate. You’re the oldest human I know. You have the most experience.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m no spring chicken but I’m not that old.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, I’ve been inside your head.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. You don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um… Do you remember what Ava calls the Diner?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, something like “a shifting point of null entropy”.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Null entropy. No decay.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you think you would age while you worked there?</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR …</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh oh.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How old-</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re a hundred and seventy-three years old… if you add all the days up.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">… That can’t be right, Ava would’ve picked up on that.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, Ava, Gloria, they all came into your life very late, comparatively. They’ve only been there a few years. Caspar, you lived an entire lifetime in the diner before they showed up. I’m sure you recall the feeling. You walked into an abandoned diner, turned on the radio, and then the days rolled into one another. It’s much harder to mark the passage of time with no one around. I’m not sure why. That’s another thing I’d like to learn, how other people create time.</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR …</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Need a minute?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apparently I’ve had plenty!</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t freak out. Compared to most things, you’re still just a kid.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t feel wise.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good. People who think themselves wise are the real idiots.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds familiar.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I got it from you. See what I mean? Bits and pieces of other people. No real me. You can help.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, fine. If you say so.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">How about this: The Teds know we’re in this ship so we should probably ditch it for another one. That’ll take a day or two. By then you should be recovered from learning that you’re as old as a bible character. Okay?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, okay.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">This’ll be fun. A dramatic hunt across three galaxies. It feels human…</p>

<p class="character">MINSKY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid so.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I’m trusting a robot to make me a drink?</p>
<p class="character">MINSKY</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, because you’re ordering a Margarita.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what?</p>
<p class="character">MINSKY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been around. I’ve never met a bartender that can make a good margarita.</p>

<p class="dialogue">No.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. They also have these things called Jalepeño Poppers. See, the Jalepeño is something that’s hot but on purpose, it’s not poison-</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. I dabble in the restaurant business. A lot of people in a lot of systems have tried and failed to make authentic Mexican food.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great idea for a night out, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">MINSKY</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the simplest thing. That box there in front of Leif belongs to an associate of mine. Leif liked to hide things here at Red’s and he thought nobody knew about it. But of course I knew. And I also knew that Leif was in trouble. So I set up camp at the bar and waited for Mr. Predictable here to make a run for his stash. Let me guess, he said you guys “deserved a night out”.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Son of a bitch, Leif!</p>
<p class="character">MINSKY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry, folks. Leif here is an old softie. There’s no way he’d let any of you get hurt on his account, so I’m sure he’ll do exactly what I say.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The box is right there, why don’t you just take it?</p>
<p class="character">MINSKY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s complicated, Gloria, for a couple of reasons. First, the box you see in front of him is called a crush box. If Leif doesn’t say the right security phrase, it instantly sucks all the oxygen out of the environment and compresses it into a little pellet, making it hard for most things in here to survive. Secondly, Leif is one of the smartest guys I know, and right now he’s trying to figure a way out of the predicament he finds himself in withOUT giving me what I want.</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’ll eventually realize there’s no way out though, and I’ve got all night, so let’s give him some time, shall we?</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Absolutely not.</p>
<p class="character">MINSKY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright. Well, since I like you guys I’ll let you in on it. It’s the Teds. They’ve got some sort of space station way out there. It’s sending out some type of signal that has you guys trapped in the “here and now” in these three galaxies.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that possible?</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fucking time crystals.</p>
<p class="character">MINSKY</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Teds are a patient bunch. They plan to trap you here in their territory, and just wait until you show up right in their lap. I also heard about the trick Leif pulled with the Purple Nullifier, nice work by the way. But they’ll be ready for that next time.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I see. Strange bedfellows. It happens all over. Interesting that you describe Leif as having a moral dilemma, though. That doesn’t seem quite like him, does it, Leif? Morals. See, to have morals you have to have made certain choices with your life. And that’s unlike Leif, to make choices. Invents something amazing on earth, gives it up in exchange for a ticket to the stars. Then what does he do? Drifts around for a while, cooks some food. Then he realizes he’s been conned by the Teds. What does he do then? Does he return to Earth to try and rectify his mistake? No. No, that would require bold choices wouldn’t it? Leif’s not about that. Instead he becomes a criminal. Now, of course, you’re saying “Hey, becoming a criminal is a bold choice. You put on a mask, you rob some banks.” But, no. That’s not actually what Leif does. What Leif does is HELP criminals COMMIT crimes. Making sure they have everything they need. Which, I’ll grant you, is still a crime, but I think we can all agree is the most non-crime way to be a criminal. Always just dangling his feet in the water. Then, he doesn’t even commit to that! He becomes a cook on a time-traveling, dimension-spanning diner. Zipping around the multi-verse, making hamburgers for the downtrodden, like that’s going to do any good. So much potential, Leif. You could’ve been so much. Instead you’re just a toddler’s toy on the floor. Batted around until you finally end up under the couch. What a waste… Well, I’ve said my piece.</p>
