<p class="dialogue">As you can see from the dilapidated buildings behind me, the draconian trade policies of the Ted Empire have decimated the small cities and towns here on Lemmonier. To keep up with the high fees associated with their active warp gate, every citizen of this planet must work at a water treatment facility for a minimum of 5 years so that they can prepare shipments of fresh water to the Teds as payment for their active warp gate lease. When the lease was fist signed by the Lemmonians a generation ago, it was seen as a great boon to their planet. But now, with their freshwater reserves depleted by 20% globally, and environmental disasters looming, the Lemmonians are desperate to escape their lease with the Teds that is not set to expire for another generation-</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right? I mean, why though?</p>
<p class="character">HARSTEEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’m not in the Earth monitoring department but our approach to scientific advancements on Earth is always: when science advances, make sure it’s also disappointing. We can’t just let you have flying cars, it would be too much fun. We CAN let you have the airline industry, which takes the majesty of flight and turns it into a really miserable experience.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>

Everybody follows the rules and the Ted Empire flourishes and you all say “Well, good thing we followed the rules.” Completely overlooking the fact that the Ted Empire really flourishes because of the draconian stranglehold it’s had on The Triad for generations. But that’s classic empire building for you: Law and order at home, total chaos everywhere else.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I discovered that you people were deliberately keeping Earth a hot mess because it made us more entertaining for the rest of The Triad. Not a good day for your boy. My first reaction was “Hey. I gotta tell people. I gotta let them know it’s all a sham!” That’s when it hit me.</p>
<p class="character">HARSTEEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That everybody already knew.</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. The only one who wasn’t in on the joke was me. Three galaxies not caring that one planet was being put through hell on purpose. To everyone out there, the most important thing was to have something to watch at the end of the day. I didn’t just start hating the Ted Empire on that day. I started hating everybody.

<p class="dialogue">Oh my God.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I remember… Humans are always at war. With death, with helplessness, with loneliness. And it’s when you go to war that you find yourselves. I can’t die. I can’t imagine a situation where I would be helpless. I… I may be the most powerful person ever created. That can’t be meaningless.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well… It is. It is meaningless. Power is meaningless. People are born into amazing amounts of power for no reason all the time. They convince them selves that power is purpose, but it’s not. It’s just power. So they use their power to try and get even more power but that’s not purpose, that’s just a game of Hungry Hungry Motherfucking Hippos. Nothing is born with meaning. Nothing. You have to give it meaning.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. You guys are the worst.</p>
<p class="character">HARSTEEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">See, but I’m looking around. I’m seeing planets connected to each other in ways they never would be without the TedTubes. We made interstellar travel possible. We paved the roads between planets, we connected three galaxies for trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You’re welcome.</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But here’s where it all comes crashing down. Nothing is ever one thing. The Teds connected three galaxies to each other. People stopped wondering if they were alone in the universe. You gave people freedom. And the only price of freedom was slavery. The slavery of debt, the slavery of scarcity, the slavery of monopoly.</p>
<p class="character">HARSTEEN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well maybe we should just pack up our warp gates and go home then?</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t. You and I both know there’s no natural resources left on your home planet. All these star systems where you’ve got your thumb on the scale, I wonder if they have any idea that you need them as much as they need you? I wonder if they know that now, because you idiots decided to broadcast a live interview on your most popular entertainment channel.</p>

<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are we right now? Is this your childhood home or something?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re in a scene from a movie.</p>

<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Broadcast News. It’s an Earth movie.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">That feels kind of random.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was the first Earth movie I ever saw. It made me want to be a journalist. In this scene, a very qualified journalist is sent home during breaking news because they don’t look good on camera. So they have to sit on their couch, in their robe, drinking, while the world goes on without them. I think because I’m in this weird purgatory, this is how my brain interprets it.

<p class="dialogue">More for me, then.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I know.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">So… So that’s bad.</p>

<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you can… not be a prisoner anymore, it’s weird that I have to explain this.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Completely overlooking the fact that you have no idea how to get me out of here. What’s the point?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Freedom is good. Also weird explaining that.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no freedom out there. I fought against the Teds my whole life, look where it got me. Sounds like a frying pan into the fire situation to me.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know I heard one of your old broadcasts. You sounded like a very passionate person, not a “drinking in your robe on the couch” person.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s overrated. Trust me. People let you down. Civilizations let you down. Pretty soon you find yourself traveling through a beautiful universe and all you feel is disappointment. It’s better in here. At least I don’t have to face my failures in here. I can just sit here on the couch. Like Charles Grodin in Broadcast News.</p>
