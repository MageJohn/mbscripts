<p class="dialogue">Interplanetary travel. Enjoyed by so many across The Triad, and made possible only by the hard work and constant innovation of The Ted Empire. With our Ted Tubes, we are able to connect all citizens of the three galaxies for trade, tourism, or to start a new life somewhere out there among the stars. But sometimes with new innovations, comes new problems, and with those problems, new responsibilities.</p>
<p class="dialogue">One of those problems is piracy. Did you know that over 1300 ships per Ted-cycle find themselves the victim of piracy? Though the Ted Empire works day and night to ensure the safety of the Ted Tube network, that doesn’t stop piracy from occurring. In this broadcast we’re going to go over the what you need to do if you hear of or are currently experiencing an act of piracy. Let’s start at the beginning. First, what is piracy?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Ladies and gentlemen and every other damn thing, live from the Galaxy Brain, it’s the Gladiator of the Galaxies, the Sultan of the Starways, The Invader Zim of the Outer Rim, The Hullabaloo of NGC 6302, iiiiiiiiiiit’s Låfftraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaax!</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: APPLAUSE.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, hello, hello, everyone out there in the great beyond it’s your old pal Låfftrax! Breaking in yet again to talk in your ear about, well, whatever the hell I want!</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: LAUGHING.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s face it, you didn’t want to listen to another damn message from the damn Teds, did you? No. You know why? Booooring! That’s why! Leave it to the Teds to have control of three galaxies and somehow make it a snooze-fest!</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: LAUGHING.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, Låfftrax can remember a time when there were no Teds. The Galaxy was run by a bunch of kings and warlords! Guys who really knew how to do galactic domination you know? They did it with style. Anybody remember Emperor Bug-Bug of the Iron Quadrant? Damn he knew how to party. That guy had a ship the size of a moon just to hold all of his other ships. The guy had a ship for his ships. And guess what? He never went anywhere. You know why? He was the damn Emperor! Everybody came to him!</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: APPLAUSE.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now look at us. Three galaxies dominated by a bunch of bean counters! It’s a disgrace! Where’s the panaché? Where’s the pageantry? Somebody ought to do something!</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, what’s that? What’s that you say? Somebody IS doing something? Oh, it’s your old pal Låfftrax? Well thank the cosmos for me, am I right?!</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: CHEERING.</p>
<p class="character">LÅFFTRAX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Folks, I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking “Låfftrax, we know the Teds suck, but what can we do about it? They control everything!”</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well if that’s the case, how am I breaking into their broadcast right now? If they control everything how am I saving you from hearing another bullshit public service announcement about what to do when you encounter a pirate?</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll tell you what to do if you encounter a pirate. Get out your thank you cards! Start writing. Write this: Dear Mr. Pirate, thank you for saving me from a galaxy that has lost all sense of style! Before I met you, life was merely survival. But now that I see you out there, breaking laws and doing all sorts of violence, I’m reminded that the universe is a pageant! That we have but one life! That control is an illusion and we are all just clumps of stardust smashing into each other and then returning to oblivion. Sincerely… and then write your name there.</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what you do when you encounter a pirate. Pirates are important, folks. They’re necessary. With the rise of every empire, something always rises in its shadow. The black market, the underworld, the Pirates! Thesis… antithesis… synthesis… it’s the way of all things…</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">“But Låfftrax” you say “Låfftrax I can’t thank you for what you do. You too are cruel! You steal, you lie, you wound, you kill. I’m to thank you for the terror you bring to the great cosmic landscape?!”</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, to that I say, look above your head, theoretical person! Atoms disintegrating. Meteors raining. Suns collapsing. Galaxies colliding! Black holes obliterating. All without a care for you or your loved ones.</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look up! Look up into the swirling gyre and ask yourself, “Should I not mimic that which bore me?! Or should I be a good citizen of the Ted Empire, attend some shitty job as a customer service rep or whatever, and wait for death to take me?”</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Only stardust colliding folks. Everything else is play-acting.</p>
<p class="dialogue">They don’t hate me for the violence, they don’t hate me for the looting, they hate me because of what I’m a reminder of. A reminder that our lives are nothing but a sandcastle on a beach, with the tides fast approaching.</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">… You know, speaking of chaos and uncertainty, I’m going to be honest. I can’t remember why I broke into this broadcast now. The spirit moved me. Anybody remember?</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah yes… Yes, I have it now… Strange things are afoot in The Triad my friends, strange things. The Teds are cracking down like never before, and with Midnight Burger zipping around our little corner of the universe, I have it on very good authority that an old friend is back in town. An old friend that I thought was gone for good. And I’m desperate to speak with him folks, DESPERATE. We have a lot of catching up to do.</p>
<p class="character">(CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s an Earthling… His name is Leif… And if you can lead me to him I can promise you a new world awaits. A world where you are cruising through the stairways guzzling FREEDOM! And it can all be brought to you by Låffrax.</p>
<p class="dialogue">My friends, before I return you to your previously scheduled boredom, let me reiterate my previous point: If you see a pirate, thank a pirate. Embrace them. Give them your valuables and perhaps a few of your children. In the end, it’s only the pirates who are doing it right…</p>

<p class="dialogue">My Dear, Gloria appears to be pondering over that cube again.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is, Dear. As if there were some sort of prize within it’s tiny frame.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue">…</p>
<p class="direction">ZEBULON …</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys. Stop, there’s nothing inside it, I’m just thinking.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry to disturb.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I went up on the roof, tried to get a good look around. I think the planet’s uninhabited.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s dead.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not just dead. It’s like it’s dying. The trees and shrubs are brown, the whole planet’s brown.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, explain to me again how this thing works.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, we already talked about it, do I have to?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t tell me you were an engineer, you didn’t tell me you were a criminal, you hid a bomb in the diner, and you put us all in danger so you could get this tiny box-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re kind of down in the polls right now, Leif. You want to bring your numbers up?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, again… The genius of The Ted Empire is that they have no leader. Over the centuries they’ve managed to evolve into an entire society of middle management. Everything is done by committee and the one who’s really in charge is the rules themselves.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is that genius?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you can’t assassinate a rulebook. The only thing that gets assassinated is personal responsibility. See it all goes back to-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Skip to the end.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. If I plug this into any Ted mainframe, in a matter of days everything stops.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The entire Ted Empire grinds to a halt.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It creates a memo. And that memo’s job is just to create another memo. And another and another and another. Each memo erodes these things called linear classifiers. A linear classifier is how a computer tells the difference between one set of data and another. In a few days this thing rips through the Ted Empire and the code that runs their empire turns into alphabet soup.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s that easy?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the end, every empire screws itself, it’s never an outside invader. This code’s really simple. So simple that they don’t even look for it anymore. Imagine a master thief trying to break into your house. They know how to hack your complicated security system, but would have no idea how to get past a moat full of alligators because nobody looks for those anymore.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Empire. How big is this empire?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s another genius thing. The Teds don’t control any territory other than their home planet, but they control everything.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It started about 250 years ago. They started building these Ted Tubes, warp gates that could take you from one side of a galaxy to another instantly. And they just kept building them. They used that to leverage control over everything else. Fast forward 250 years and there’s very few parts of your life that don’t involve the Ted Empire.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s all it took?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Remember when Amazon was a bookstore?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t understand, if the Teds are so bad, why didn’t you just use this thing back when you made it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I tried to explain this to you-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Explain it again.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi. What are you guys talking about?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Something weird’s going on outside, I need my pencil.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I’m going to figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">With a pencil?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know how many problems have been solved with pencils? I’m taking the radio too, c’mon guys.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well alright, just remember what happened yesterday when we tagged along.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Why are we not telling Ava about this?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because Ava is a friggin’ chaos wizard who’ll want to use a doomsday device just to see what happens.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I just want to say, I kept it a secret but now you’re keeping it a secret and that feels like a double-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh don’t even start with that shit. Let’s go outside and see what she’s talking about.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What’s going on?</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m looking at the sun.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I shouldn’t be able to look at the sun but I’m looking at the sun.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird, I’m looking at it, too.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it an eclipse?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, because watch this…</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, it’s bright again.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And now we can’t look at the sun but then wait for another second…</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s dark again.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not a cloud in the sky so it’s not the weather, and there’s no pattern to it. It fluctuates randomly.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s acting like some kind of a light bulb that needs changing.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, is it possible for a sun to be like a light bulb, for it to need changing?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but when they need changing they explode and obliterate everything for billions of kilometers.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then collapse into a black hole.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think a simple yes or no would do.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, I know you are regarding this strange land as a simple curiosity but I’m feeling a certain way about it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going on, Effie?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is a sadness here. One that overwhelms. As though we’ve caught the story at its end.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well the sun’s acting weird and the planet’s dying, I’m assuming the two are related.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re definitely related but…</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This just isn’t how planets die in the universe.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Doesn’t surprise me. It’s a plant. Look at the sun on this planet, I’m surprised it’s not dead just like everything else here.</p>

<p class="dialogue">But it’s not dead, it’s alive, which means… we have a customer. And our customer is dying. Shit. Okay… it’s a plant. Plants need dirt and sunlight. It’s got plenty of dirt around here so it needs sun. How do we make a sun?</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where the fuck are we?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been told to be direct so: You’re in the digestive chamber of a gigantic carnivorous plant.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m what?!</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>

<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, so this particular creature is an apex predator-</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Be direct!</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two reasons 1) Their digestive process is incredibly slow and 2) Me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you have to do with it?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve co-existed with these creatures for centuries. Over epochs of evolution we’ve learned how to taste bad.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Taste bad?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Eventually it’s going to realize it accidentally ate me and will… void itself.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Void itself?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re about to get puked up by a carnivorous plant?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, THAT’s what puke means.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When is this going to happen?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any time now.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">…You’re sure?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">…Fine… it smells terrible in here.</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a digestive chamber, what were you expecting?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was expecting to not get eaten by a giant plant and then told by a four foot plant that everything’s going to be fine. I think that’s a realistic fucking expectation.</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fair, sure.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, perhaps some introductions are in order before you roll out any more explosions of foul language?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m being digested. You want me to make tea?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, our new friend has assured us that you’re going to be just fine.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And not to put too fine a point on it but our new friend did heroically leap into the innards of this behemoth to insure you wouldn’t be harmed.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you expect me to do?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We just said introductions, Dear I can’t believe I have to explain these things to her.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again, I’ve given up.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. I’m Ava. What’s your name?</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great, that went well.</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, I know what it is but when I absorbed your language lexicon proper names don’t transfer very well.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Give it a shot.</p>
<p class="character">PLANT PERSON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay… My name is Sheliaksimmeonsuliasamiasulia.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just going to go with Shel.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. Shel. I like it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um… what’s something small and dumb on your planet?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Most things on my planet are small and dumb. A squirrel?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Isn’t you saying to me “So, you’re a plant.” Like me saying to you “So, you’re a squirrel?”</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fair… Photosynthetic?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you don’t have a root system, obviously.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not for several thousand… years? Is that the word?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Years. And how are you speaking to me?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Spores. I’m constantly emitting them from my body. Some of them interact with your brain’s language center and report back.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You put spores in my brain?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I’m realizing now that sounds alarming. They’re harmless. It’s just… it’s how we talk.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Well, you’re lucky a lot of weird shit has happened to me, I don’t phase easily.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m noticing the word “shit” has many uses.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">That isn’t confusing?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh… No, it’s really not.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Speaking of weird shit, can you explain this talking box to me?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not really. You kind of just have to go with it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well we have no trouble explaining ourselves. I’m Zebulon Mucklewain here with my wife Effie.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, Shel.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh… hi. They scare me, are they supposed to scare me?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. At first.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">So… who are you guys?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re traveling salesmen, can I interest you in a set of encyclopedias?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t understand most of that.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Myself, my wife, Ava, and our friends travel all of God’s creation helping those in need.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Help” is a strong word.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t suppose you know how to fix the sun, do you?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Your sun doesn’t need fixing.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">It may seem that way to you-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone’s blocking it. Someone’s blocking the sun. We call it a Dyson Sphere. For us it’s just in science fiction novels but someone went and made a real one. It’s a massive construct that wraps around an entire star and harnesses it’s energy. The downside is that anyone who depends on that star for warmth, gets screwed. Especially if it’s a planet of people who get their energy directly from the sun. Like you.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would someone do that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because if you want to do anything big, you need massive amounts of energy. And in any universe the biggest source of energy will always be a star. Especially your star. Your star is very special, there’s only a few like it.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone… killed us?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry. Yes.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, this land appears to us as a field that’s been left to fallow, waiting for a new wave of life. Do you mean to say that because the sky has been so darkened that that new life will never come?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, there will probably always be residual microbes, but life can’t exist on this planet anymore. Sorry.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ll have to forgive Ava, Shel. She has a tendency to discard the emotional content of the moment.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aw, Zebulon, you say the nicest things.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, stop. Who did this? Why would they do this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shel, I’m sorry, it’s hard for me to talk to you because I don’t know anything about you. Do you know that there are other civilizations on other planets?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">We did. Every once and a while we’d get visitors from the sky. They said they came here to study us. They said there weren’t a lot of people like us out there. They were nice for the most part. They would tell us about where they came from. They would tell us about the things they built and the places they had been. It all sounded interesting but… My people don’t… my people didn’t build things.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you seem very intelligent.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are very intelligent. But we don’t need things. From the second I split from my seed I had everything I needed. Sunlight and soil. We’re born perfect. Why would we build things? Why would we want to? So when you tell me that someone built something so big that it covered up our sun… I don’t understand it. Do they know what they’re doing, do they know what they’re destroying?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, Shel. But, probably. If you have the ability to create something so massive, you definitely have the ability to check the nearby planets for life.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me why they would do this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shel, I can’t tell you why. It’s a race called The Teds and… they’re dicks.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can tell you why, Shel.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">My wife and I have spent our lives studying a book called The Bible. Now, I won’t speak on it too much since I know that it won’t mean much to you. But I can tell you what it has taught me. There is one sin above all others that poisons humanity. Do you understand this word? Sin.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Arrogance, Shel. It’s a word that’s been ground down over time to mean foolishness or over-confidence. But the arrogance we speak of is the sin of putting yourself before another. To decide that another is outside of God’s blessing.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others before you count yourself.” That is the way. And these beings who have darkened your landscapes have strayed far from that path.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">They don’t even care.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">They do not.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d you manage to survive all this time?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t move around a lot. We may have abandoned our root systems a long time ago, but we still don’t travel very far from where we’re born. But I figured out that the patches of sunlight moved. So I moved with them. It’s unlike us to do that, but I kind of liked it. It suited me, I guess. So I just walked and walked, trying to keep up with the sun. I don’t even know how far I travelled. But then the patches of sun got smaller and smaller. I got more and more tired all the time. Today I could hardly move but then I saw you all outside and ran to warn you about the big plant that was about to eat you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You failed.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry. It really is going to be fine, just give it time. If it’s any condolence, I’m still having a worse day than you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s true.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have two languages. Like Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Quare duas linguas loqueris?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh jeez, um… Natus sum loqui anglicus. Didici latine, cum senior essem.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come again, y’all?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shel sucked the Latin out of my head. Glad to know it’s still in there. Latin’s a dead language so of course a bunch of scientists speak it. I’m a scientist so I speak it.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s another one. Scientist. What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t know what scientist means?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that possible?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t have scientists on your planet?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I don’t know what a scientist is, how am I going to know-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone who… looks at the world and tries to figure out how it works.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. I do that all the time, does that make me a scientist?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well you do know Latin.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like that’s all I’ve thought about lately. I don’t know why. I’ve been walking across my planet, wondering how I got here.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would walk past all these dying trees and grasses and bushes and wonder, “Why am I the one who wonders?” Why not the other living things on this planet? Why do they get to be so blissfully unaware of everything that’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve been thinking about how you got here?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think that’s fairly natural, Shel. Often times when reaching the end of a road we think about it’s beginnings.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">You said that a scientist thinks about the way things work. Have you ever thought about this? About how we all got here? How it all began?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon, you want to tell Shel about the garden of Eden?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe Shel is taking in quite a lot right now, Ava. Best to not confuse things.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m trying to be accommodating over here.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not at all trying to do that, Ava, but we do appreciate you pretending to.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So far I’ve had a very good attitude for someone being slowly digested.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Listen to me, though… I’m dying. My planet is already dead and I’m trying to create some meaning before I turn to dust like everything else. Can you tell me how I got here, please?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Yes, I can. Too much energy.</p>

It’s not like there was a lot of us to begin with. I would try and convince them to walk with me, but they were old. Set in their ways. The thing is, when I meet someone like me, we exchange spores. I carry the genetic information of everyone I’ve met inside of me. My entire race may be inside of me. So it doesn’t feel like I’m dying alone. At least there’s that.</p>
