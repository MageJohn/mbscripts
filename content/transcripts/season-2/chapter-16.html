<p class="direction">SFX: THE UNDERSIGNAL THEME SONG.</p>
<p class="character">MR. UNDERSIGNAL</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the Undersignal, the voice of freedom in the triad. For many days now Midnight Burger has been tearing a path of chaos through the systems, as the Ted Empire struggles with damage control. On the planet of Benijessica, Leif of Midnight Burger puts the troubled planet on the path of energy independence...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This planet’s energy grid was about as efficient as a canvas-topped submarine, with these new schematics you’ll be able to stop importing fuel from the Teds and stand on your own two feet.</p>
<p class="character">BYSTANDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">We love you, Leif!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We love you!</p>
<p class="character">MR. UNDERSIGNAL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then, on the planet of Cariel-3, Dr. Ava Maddox confronts the Science-Priests of the High Temple of Moog...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Listen guys, I’m not going to lie, Science-Priest is a pretty amazing title, I’m kind of jealous. But if you’re going to throw the word science in there without any actual scientific knowledge, let’s consider the words of Kepler: “Before we go all in on this religion garbage, maybe we should, you know, try literally everything else.” I’m paraphrasing.</p>
<p class="character">MR. UNDERSIGNAL</p>
<p class="dialogue">And warring factions of the planet of Fikin-G were finally brought to the bargaining table by Midnight Burger’s leader, Gloria, and peace was forged using a sacred Earth tradition...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, you guys, the Teds have been funding both sides of this war for years, why don’t we stop fighting and talk about who the REAL enemy is? And remember, when all five dice are the same, you have to shout “Yahtzee”.</p>
<p class="character">MR. UNDERSIGNAL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now the entire Triad waits with bated breath to see where the mysterious diner will appear next. And when they do, will the Ted Empire finally have an opportunity to put an end to Midnight Burger’s path of chaos that has inspired the downtrodden all across the system? Stay tuned to The Undersignal, the voice of freedom in The Triad, as the story develops...</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: VERY BUSY DINER.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus, these people are hungry!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a line out the door, I can’t even see where it ends!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just finished emergency inventory and it’s pretty Dickensian in the walk-in, we’re basically out of food.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve only been here an hour! Why are they so hungry?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, I can’t understand a word they’re saying.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what happens when you open the rebellion cafe, everyone wants to come here with their beret on.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, this ain’t just a busy shift. We can’t understand a word these people are saying either but their situation is dire.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been in a billion dire situations in the last two weeks, guys.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But this is something new. Not just a dire situation but… what is the word?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Portent, dear.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s it, dear. Thank you. Portent, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever, guys.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Something important is to happen here.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s so strong that I feel it myself. There is a weight to this day.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A weight. That’s it indeed.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel it is a day of a great sermon.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, amen.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys. We’re in the weeds here, there’s not going to be any time for Zebulon to give a sermon.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is the puzzling bit, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The sermon will not be given by us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll do it.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You will not.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">C’mon, you don’t think they want to hear a lecture on Magnetars? It’s a barn burner, I have jokes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need to understand what these people are saying, where’s Shel?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I sent Shel outside to talk to people, maybe they can figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mmm. Can you feel it coming together, my Dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, yes, husband. Throngs of the hungry, seeking guidance. All of them gathered together, their confusion their only commonality.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not to mention it’s a lovely day out.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is sermon o’clock and we are late, dear.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">How might we contribute to this day of importance, I wonder?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we’ve got the throngs of people, we have an eagerness for guidance, we’ve got the sunshine, what else do we need?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apostles.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be an apostle.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, you will not.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love flowing garments.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perhaps not Paul and Mark and the rest but a way to spread the good word far and wide.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can spread the good word far and wide.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did I just say?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not in a Jesus way, in a science way.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you mean, Ava?</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: BACK DOOR SLAMMING.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">WOW, these people are chatty! Okay, everybody huddle up. It was hard to get them to talk to me. They kept screaming and running away in fear.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, seriously am I really the only photosynthetic motherfucker in the galaxy?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop teaching Shel to curse!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Skills are important.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, I stopped trying to talk to people and I just stood really still. Eventually they mistook me for a bush and they started yapping away. Everyone, welcome to the planet Milinov. They are BIG fans of you guys. Such big fans that as soon as we started our war with The Teds, they shut down their warp gate in protest.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, great.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what we were afraid of.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apparently this was a really bad idea.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it was.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">All their food comes from somewhere else, I guess? What’s the place that makes food?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A farm.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, there’s none of those.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">On the whole planet?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that bad?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes!</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also, basically all they have on this planet are restaurants. That’s what we are right?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The whole planet?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. People come here from other planets to eat at the restaurants and then go to something called a spa.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit, it’s a leisure planet.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds excellent except for the small detail of everyone starving.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is exactly what I was talking about.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t start with me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck were they thinking? They shut off their only means of getting food, what was their endgame?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes you’re too miserable to think about the endgame.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds familiar.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I said don’t start with me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">On a related note, I just checked the calendar and it’s National Use Your Doomsday Device Day and I know a great way to celebrate.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’ll just make it worse.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also, there’s something floating in the parking lot.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God, Leif, your ex is here.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What the hell is this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a message drone.</p>
<p class="character">DRONE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have one message.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t listen to it.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Play the message.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From message drone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh hey, Midnight Burger. Ted Empire calling. I decided to leave you a little message on every planet just because I wanted to let you guys know that your highly-publicized guerrilla warfare is, guess what? Worthless! I’m sure you guys think you’re out there fighting the good fight but you’re basically congratulating yourselves for shooting an elephant with a rubber band. But this is what I expect from you Earthlings. Your planet has not spent NEARLY enough time thinking about the futility of your actions. Except for the Danish. They’ve really got the pointlessness of life nailed. A bunch of existentially exhausted beans over there. Oh, and by the way, this message has just pinged us with your location. Better hope there’s no Ted ships in the area! See you soon!</p>
<p class="character">DRONE</p>
<p class="dialogue">End of message. Would you like to reply?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t reply.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m replying.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Telling them to fuck off isn’t going to do anything.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you want me to do, beg for our lives?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The people on this planet are begging for their lives because of what we started.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t ask anybody to starve themselves.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, for two weeks we’ve been on an anti-goodwill tour, did you think people were just going to sit there? No. They’re going to get all riled up like this planet has and then expect us to save them somehow. Now we’ve shown up on a starving planet without any food. This was bound to happen.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I’m taking Effie and Zebulon up to the roof, come with me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have an idea.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">An idea about what?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Haven’t you heard? There’s going to be a sermon today.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie and Zebulon said so.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are you?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m the person in the diner who’s smarter than you. Come up to the roof.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You think this is a good time to say “I told you so”?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did tell you so. So, yes.</p>
<p class="character">DRONE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would you like to reply?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">…What’s going to happen to them?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’ll surrender eventually. Probably get a heavy fine from the Teds. It’ll take a generation for them to pay it off. But they’ll be okay. You’re right, you didn’t ask them to do this. It was irrational of them, you can’t go up against these guys unless you have a plan.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you talking about them or me?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">…Look. I’m going to go in there, serve the last of our food and apologize. It’s all we can do at this point.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then what do we do?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, after that, I’m making a gun.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The fuck for, leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Teds just got pinged with our location, this could be the end of the road. If they think I have a weapon they might hesitate for a second, give us a chance to slip away.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about the purple nurple?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Purple Nullifier. That only works once, they’ll have a plan for it next time. So I’m making a plasma cannon. It’ll only have one shot but they’ll have to go into a standoff protocol and that’ll take some time.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We weren’t going to be able to keep this up forever. Honestly, I’m surprised we made it this long. I’ll be on the roof.</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">DRONE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would you like to reply?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Psst. Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shel, you don’t have to pretend to be a bush anymore.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m kind of enjoying it. Ava calls it “doing spy shit”.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Enjoy.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">It kind of scares me when you and Leif fight.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve been fighting a lot lately.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I also can’t quite tell what you’re fighting about. It’s almost like when humans argue they’re arguing about two things at the same time but one of those things isn’t being said and the other one is.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, we definitely do that.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what’s the thing that isn’t being said?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, Shel.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">… it’s messy out here.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s messy?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Out here. All these planets, all these people, it’s a mess.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It really is.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like you’ve been trying to make some sense of it. I’ve really appreciated that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what I’ve been trying to do.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I knew what things were on my planet, it was a lot simpler. Sun coming up: good. Lightning storm: bad. Things are a little different out here, though. Something can be good, but is it though? Something can be bad, but have you considered this that and the other thing? Maybe when you consider this that and the other thing maybe the thing you thought was bad is actually good and that good thing you’ve been talking about is actually a total fucking disaster. It’s confusing. But recently you’ve been heading out into this uncertainty and you’ve been saying “Hey. This is wrong and this is right and shut up about it.” And I’ve appreciated that. It’s understandable, like the sunrise and lightning storms.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t feel that way.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, come here. Get off the parking lot and put your feet on the dirt.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just do it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. What?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a shame they don’t have farms on this planet. The soil here is amazing. You can’t feel it but I can. All kinds of weird bacteria, complex nutrients, and don’t even get me started on the mycelial network.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The what?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mushrooms. You like mushrooms, right?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">The mushroom is just the visible part. Under a mushroom is a network of fungus strands that can run for miles, colonies of fungus all talking to each other. When I stand here they talk to me, too.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s it saying?</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, not with words, it’s not talking fungus, I mean… I can feel the whole planet. And under the ground, underneath all the complexity and confusion and anger… something is working, and it’s working perfectly.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wish I could feel that like you can.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">The soil is just begging to have things planted in it. I wonder how it got that way?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess from the people here not using it.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s more than that. At first I thought it was volcanoes. Volcanoes make for great soil, but nothing this complicated. It’s… oh wait…</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

Word of advice, when you want to let someone know that what they’re doing is insignificant, don’t go out of your way to let them know they’re insignificant, don’t send them a “just to let you know, I’m totally over you” message. You’re kind of showing your whole Ass on that one, were you drunk when you sent this? It is pretty adorable that you’re  trying to intimidate me. But honestly, between the sexists, the racists, shitty tippers, and the guys screaming “go back to your country” from their car, to me, you’re just the next asshole. See you soon!</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this really the most important thing right now?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have told him how important this day is, have we not, dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have, dear. I certainly hope Leif was paying attention when we explained this, other wise I would have to be very disappointed in him.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The people on this planet are starving, we don’t have any food and the Teds are coming, you want to talk about theoretical physics?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We would like to talk about an important day, Leif. There will be a great message delivered and Ava, though we don’t understand her particular divinations, has said she would like to help.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which is a miracle all on its own.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not getting out of this, am I?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are not.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. You were saying?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Consciousness needs a complicated arrangement of atoms, right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But over my shoulder are a couple of conscious minds with no atoms.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So hear me out, what if, instead of a complicated arrangement of atoms, it’s a complicated arrangement of waves.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you saying?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A microwave. You put your frozen burrito in the microwave but you only have microwaves coming from one direction, what happens?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, but multiple microwave emissions from multiple points, all crossing each other at the point of your burrito and what do you get?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lunch.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re saying that Effie and Zebulon’s consciousness is a hot burrito.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Except the product of the arrangement of waves is not a hot burrito, but in fact a conscious mind.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s insane.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know! Mad scientist Thundercrash!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought you told me they were… I feel uncomfortable talking about this in front of them.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They don’t understand what we’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true, Leif, it’s all gobbledegook to us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">See?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought you told me their consciousness was fabricated by some sort of unknown entity.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I never said fabricated.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie and Zebulon Mucklewain were real people. They lived in Arkansas in 1925 and that’s not them.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, by that logic everyone’s fabricated. You were fabricated by the 3D printer in your mothers womb. The ink in the printer was the genetic information from your mother and your father. I’m assuming you’re more than your genetic makeup.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie and Zebulon were created based on two real people, but that’s just where they started.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t just create a consciousness based on two people.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell that to your mother, that’s what she did.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, forget I asked, at what point am I building something?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t need you to build something. I just need an analysis of this planet’s radio frequency traffic.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s some sort of relationship between the Mucklewains and waves. If they’re made of wave forms then they can kind of y’know, “speak wave form”.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re the only theorist I’ve ever met who says things like “kind of, y’know”.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s going to work, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going to work?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This planet’s an advanced civilization, they probably have communication satellites right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If we can get the Mucklewains to grab the right signal, we can broadcast to the entire planet.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What for?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because there’s going to be a sermon, dude.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t care about the sermon you just want to mess around with your toys.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, this is the most disagreeable I’ve ever seen you, who put the snakes in your pants?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t have snakes in my pants, I just don’t understand why we’re thinking about this right now.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’s an important day, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re right, it is an important day, it’s the day we get caught by the Teds and thrown in deep cold storage, do you want me to tell you about deep cold storage!</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do not raise your voice to me, young man!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">…</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif. The reason why you’ve been hemming and hawing for the past weeks is not because Gloria is doing the wrong thing but because she’s doing the right thing and we all know it. And that stings a bit for you, Leif, because the right thing that she’s doing is the thing you should’ve done a long time ago. These oppressors who have been chasing us, they’re no strangers to you, Leif, but you chose not to oppose them and instead retreated into childish mayhem. But now we see Gloria, ill-equipped though she may be, standing against them as you should have.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, we understand that to look back and feel that another path should’ve been taken can be a harsh view to digest.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You may not approve of Gloria’s actions, but can you hardly blame her? She has faced down evil and prayed for mighty assistance, as we all should.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even if it’s pointless? Even if you suffer and it changes nothing?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, Leif. Even if that. Who do you think you’re talking to?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, guys. I wish I could go with you on that. Purity in the face of certain doom is appealing, I guess, but it’s not me. I spent the majority of my life with certain death right outside the airlock, I survive things. I’ve never really cared much how I survive them.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well you went and messed that up when you got yourself some friends, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">One cannot be a creature of simple survival and a creature with loved ones. For when you care for another you take on their dangers and complications.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s dangerous to care for another, Leif. But it’s always worth the trade off, and the reason you’re so upset is because you know I’m right.</p>

<p class="dialogue">As would I, dear. But all of you listening at home, we can’t make this decision for you. All we can do is show you a way forward, and hope that the decisions you make can feel right in the eyes of your God. Or gods. Or however y’all do it here.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, perhaps they need a bit more convincing. Perhaps someone should stand before them, make a bit of a speech, convince them there is nothing to fear?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You mean like a sermon?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did not say sermon, did you say sermon, dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did not say sermon, dear. I don’t even know what you mean by that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine, who’s doing it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">All you.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not doing it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is it me?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cause you’re the boss.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. Fine, okay. Shel, get into the crowd and start translating.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here I go.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone. Everyone, can I have your attention? I know this is a strange day for you, I appreciate you showing up at all… So… On my home planet there’s this thing called Top Ramen. It’s dried noodles and a packet of flavoring. It’s not very good for you but it’s food. And you can get them for 50 cents each. That’s not a lot where I’m from. I never ate it all that much myself, but it was always nice knowing it was there. You knew you were never going to starve because of a cheap package of dried noodles always waiting for you at any store. It’s nice.</p>
<p class="dialogue">What a lot of people don’t know is that the reason why there’s dirt cheap noodles at any store, is because one day, a long time ago, two nuclear bombs were detonated on an island called Japan. Thousands of people died in an instant, and in the aftermath thousands more were going to die of sickness and starvation. But one man had an idea to send bricks of dried noodles with a packet of flavoring to anyone who was hungry. They knew they weren’t going to starve. On the island of Jamaica they cook chicken in a way that doesn’t make any smoke. They do that because a long time ago, they were slaves, and the smoke would’ve alerted slavers and they would then be running for their lives. Zebulon, why do Jewish people eat unleavened bread?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because they too were slaves. When word came from Moses that it was time to flee captivity in the night, they had no time to wait for their bread to rise. So to this day, the flat bread is a reminder of that flight from their oppressor.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">For me, when I cook with corn, beans, and squash, it’s called the tres hermanas. The same way my ancestors cooked thousands of years ago. My ancestors who were nearly wiped out by foreign invaders… Show me your plate, and I’ll tell you a sad, sad story. Your sad story begins today. The day you had to turn to the spirits of your ancestors to keep you alive while you were just trying to do the right thing, and leave a better life for your children. I can’t make you eat this food. It’s your story, not mine. So Zebulon’s going to say a prayer, and then you’re all going to make a choice. It’s up to you.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bless us, O Lord. Bless our food and our drink. Since you redeemed us so dearly and delivered us from evil, as you gave us a share in this food so may you give us a share in eternal life.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aaaaaand now we wait.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You couldn’t have made it more plain. You literally served it to them on a platter.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks, Shel.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">So eating isn’t just a gross thing you do with your face, it’s also a story.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is, absolutely.</p>
<p class="character">SHEL</p>
