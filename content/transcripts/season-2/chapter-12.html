<p class="dialogue">My friends, I wish to speak today on the power of our choices. Though not all be warriors, the Lord hath given us all a sword at birth. A sword to carry with us through our lives. Not for war, not for safety, but a sword that cleaves the path in front of you in twain. A instrument by which one can say “I choose this, and refuse the other”.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">One who is given this sword of choice may see themselves as an agent of destiny, carving out the world as we know it by choosing. Perhaps you cut away excess, perhaps you pierce the veil of ignorance, perhaps you strike down those that would use their sword against you.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone who serves aboard this ship is required to speak English.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You’re the only one who serves on this ship, Ted.</p>

<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right now it’s finding Dr. Ava Maddox.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. When you were abducting me did you think to look for her between the cushions in the booths, because things get stuck down there.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Spare change, your favorite pen, an ambassador one time-</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well it’s good to have a dream.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you think I was kidding about deep cold storage?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think the problem there is, I have no idea what it is. Describe it to me, really paint a picture that will help me feel the fear you’re going for.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">We freeze you in a block of chemical ice where you will be semi-conscious, forever, until we decide to thaw you out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are meals provided?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s suspended animation, there are no meals.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I have a clear picture now but, no, still not doing it for me.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Being semi-conscious doesn’t sound so bad. Some people work their whole lives to get semi-conscious have you even met a Buddhist or an EDM artist?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are other things-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I’m sure there are other things you can do to me, I’m sure you have a pain stick or something.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but we can make one.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">OR, how about you share some information with me. Maybe it’ll put me in a sharing mood. Make that Stockholm Syndrome kick in. Stockholm Syndrome is a-</p>

<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s my job, I’m an Earth Expert.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">An Earth Expert? That sounds like a terrible job.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And how did this become your chosen profession?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t choose professions on Ted, we’re assigned professions according to our skill set.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How inspiring. What was the skill that got you this job?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">A high tolerance for idiocy.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, you’d definitely need some of that studying Earth. I mean, World War I alone.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually my favorite is the Bucket War.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The what?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">In Italy. Two provinces, Modena and Bologna. Modena stole the bucket from the well in Bologna. So they went to war. Two thousand people died.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow. You know, I know that sounds ridiculous but when you find a REALLY good bucket-</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">My favorite part is that, to this day, you can still go to Modena and see the bucket displayed as a point of pride. Two-thousand people dead, over a bucket, and they’re bragging about it. That’s what it’s like studying Earth.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t seem too happy with your career placement.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s better than the alternative.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doesn’t sound like there is an alternative.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Earth, for example. When a child is born on Earth you tell them “When you grow up, you can be anything you want to be.” You don’t tell them that, along with that statement, comes a gigantic obligation to actually be something. So they go out into the world to “be something” and realize that there are multiple barriers standing in the way of them “being” anything at all. And then they beat their head against the wall for a while and finally end up settling for whatever the status quo demands they do. And when they finally do give up, because they were told “you can be whatever you want to be”, it’s then their fault that they didn’t end up being anything. I’ll take my system over yours.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s pretty dark, Ted.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the music’s nice on Earth.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s true.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Some of it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s… true.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, there. I gave you some information, can we get back to the matter at hand?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what was that again?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where is Dr. Ava Maddox?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. That. The memory you showed me, that’s pretty fancy technology.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s called a Mem-Sim. We can re-enact most memories.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mem-Sim? Are we sure about that name?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, I’m not a naming expert, I’m an Earth expert.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well why didn’t you just use this unfortunately named technology to get the information out of my head?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re working on it. The simulations take a while to put together. In the meantime I thought I’d come in here and try and cut to the chase rather than wait.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see. So the information you want from me, you’re going to get it anyway, but you want to get it faster?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’d be more convenient for you.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’m sure I’m going to be very helpful, then.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deep-cold storage, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did you show me that memory? That was her first day at the diner, why show me that?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do you think?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, is it quiz time?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay um… um um um um… oh! She found the diner.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Using a mathematical equation, she found your vessel. We would like to know that equation.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her notes aren’t enough?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh… How fast does this ship go?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just curious.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t matter how fast it goes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But it matters to me, Ted. I’m trying to make a point.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like most ships in The Triad we travel mostly through tubes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tubes?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Warp tubes. They’re set up throughout the three systems. You fly through a tube it sends you from one place to another through spatial distortion. Like a highway.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you said “The Triad”?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Playing dumb isn’t going to get you anywhere, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what The Triad is.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s my understanding you’ve been aboard your vessel for quite some time, you have no idea what The Triad is?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I may zip all around the cosmos but ironically I don’t get out much.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Three galaxies. The Milky Way, Andromeda, and Triangulum. They’re all connected through a series of several thousand warp tubes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like a highway.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And who built this highway?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">We did.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aha. So if anyone in these three galaxies wants to go anywhere, they have to talk to you?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine that gives the Ted Empire quite a lot of power.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It does.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And it must be very frustrating for you when you encounter something that can travel without using one of your tubes.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">…Where is Dr. Ava Maddox?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Y’know, it’s funny. You’re an advanced civilization with deep-cold storage and spaceships and Mem-sims and intergalactic highways and you are desperate to find a scientist from a planet who’s greatest technological achievement is a phone with a camera on it.

<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes! It’s incredibly embarrassing! You know what we have to do to make one warp gate? We have to harness the power of an entire star. We black out an entire solar system just so we can go a few million light-years. And then YOU assholes go shooting through the system without harnessing anything, doing good deeds, asking people if they’d like to hear the specials!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where’s the harm in that?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you make people imagine something better. And that’s bad business for us. So they commissioned this ship to hunt down Midnight Burger, harness its power and if we can’t do that, destroy it!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Mem-sim.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, that one. Any second now it’ll suck the memory out of my head and I’ll be useless to you.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re having problems with your brain.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Preach, sister.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re saying it’s because of all the time travel. It’s effected your brain. The older memories are easy to get to but not the newer ones.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds like that’s giving me all sorts of tumors. That’ll be fun one day.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">So until they figure it out the only choice-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to tell you-</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. I know alright? Enough already.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oof, Ted your coffee’s terrible. Pull up a chair, let’s talk. I’ll talk about anything you want to talk about except for the thing you want to talk about. C’mon, you’ve been chasing the diner around for God knows how long, you’ve got to have questions. Have some terrible coffee.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Coffee’s poisonous to a Ted.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It shows.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a question.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here we go.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Babba Yaga’s Hut.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">According to my records you made several stops in Eastern Europe, 15th and 16th century?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh right. We spent some time there.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doing what?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There were a lot of Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition at the time, we gave them coffee and food on their way.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">That didn’t seem strange to them?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, no one was really drinking coffee in Europe at the time so yeah, it was a little strange.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean for 15th century jews to see a diner along the road.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it was strange. So they called it Babba Yaga’s hut. It’s an old folktale. There’s this old witch, she has this hut with giant chicken legs and it can magically take you wherever you want.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">So they looked at your diner and saw a hut with chicken legs.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I guess. They saw what they needed to see.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">So my question is, how do you know you’re not doing the same thing? How do you know you’re not seeing a diner because that’s what you need to see?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, Ted. You’ve been forced from birth to study a planet you hate and you insist that that’s a good thing. How do you know you’re not seeing what you want to see? Travel around the cosmos enough and the most common thing that you’ll see is someone looking at something they can’t explain and seeing something they need to see. So yeah, it’s possible, my question is: what difference does it make?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you do that? How do you just swim in ambiguity like that? Flying around in a magical diner and you never stop for a second and say “Hey, what the fuck?” You just shrug your shoulders?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doesn’t every line of questioning eventually lead to shrugging your shoulders. Issac Newton is like “Guys, check it out, gravity.” And everyone’s like “Cool, why’s it there?” Shrug.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we’ve figured out that particular shrug.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then there’s another shrug after that, and another shrug and another shrug and another shrug. Turtles all the way down. “Turtles all the way down.” What’s the reference? C’mon, Earth expert.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, the Regress Argument in Epistemology.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Boom. You would crush on Jeopardy.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">My people don’t like the regress argument.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, you mean the argument that says you can never really know anything? That’s because you come from a planet of smartypants knowitalls. Look at you out here.</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re trying to chase down this thing you can’t explain, when you catch it you’re going to try and explain it and if you can’t you’re going to what?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Destroy it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Blow it up, Ted. That’s hilarious. “I can’t explain this thing, so I must destroy it.” Are you sure you’re not human?</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It says in your file you worked at the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did you do there?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Y’know, you take a number and come up to the counter. I was that guy.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not a high skilled job.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. You’ve got to know what you’re doing.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not the kind of job where you would encounter the Regress Argument.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. But there was a lot of shrugging. “How’re you going to pay that fine?” Shrug. I guess I picked it up somewhere on the diner.</p>
<p class="character">TED</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long have you been there?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t remember. I walked in the door one day, turned on the radio and it was all a blur until Leif showed up. Other people made me notice the time. Little did I know you were out there the entire time trying to track us down in your Mystery Machine …Hey, wait a minute. You were there. You found us. You kidnapped me, you took Ava’s notes, why’d you leave? The goal was to catch us, right?</p>
