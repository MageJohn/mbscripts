<p class="parenthetical">(Irish Brogue)</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s on me, is it? I’m afraid you’re mistaken once again. There you go again, Bart, blaming the Irish for all your problems.</p>
<p class="character">BART-13</p>
<p class="dialogue">I got all kinds a problems with you, only one of em’s that your Irish.</p>
<p class="character">BART-7</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well look at you, you just strung a whole sentence together. Do you need to take a rest now from puttin one word in front a the other for so long?</p>
<p class="character">BART-13</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s about I put you to rest right now?</p>
<p class="character">BART-43</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aw Hell, Bart can we get through a damn hand of cards without you makin’ like you’re going to kill somebody?</p>
<p class="character">BART-7</p>
<p class="dialogue">Since we’re gamblin’ anyway, can I put money on that question? The odds are very much in my favor.</p>
<p class="character">BART-13</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would you shut your Irish trap and play your hand.</p>
<p class="character">BART-7</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’d love to, you side of beef, but the action’s not on me. It’s on our new friend.</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(Southern drawl)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I apologize, gentlemen. I’m new in town and this particular game has not meandered it’s way down into my part of this great land of ours. I’m afraid we’re going to have to go through this once again.</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re sayin to me that the two cards in front of me are my own, yet the five cards out on the table belong to all of us.</p>
<p class="character">BART-13</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I can tell now why this game is not for me, I don’t approve of living communally. But, gentlemen, while we’re paused, do you mind if I bend your ears for a bit?</p>
<p class="character">BART-13</p>
<p class="dialogue">We ain’t paused, we’re waitin on you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, is there another way to define a pause?</p>
<p class="character">BART-43</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mister, you’re holdin up this game and Bart here tends to shoot things dead that interrupt his card game and it don’t matter who. I seen him shoot a cow, his dog, his cousin, he even winged his Mee-maw one time.</p>
<p class="character">BART-13</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want to be next on the list?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Bart, how do you have any bullets left after getting interrupted so many times?</p>
<p class="character">BART-13</p>
<p class="dialogue">They keep makin ‘em I’ll keep usin’ em.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that there is a lesson in supply and demand, either that or the cycle of violence, I can never tell which.</p>

<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there, Bart. Did you just say that your hand was on your gun, because that means I’ve got to put this here gun to the back of your head.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bart, allow me to introduce my associate Madame DuFarge, she has come all the way here from Atlanta. Have y’all been to Atlanta? It is so hot there, I sweat through my coat, y’all.</p>
<p class="character">BART-7</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mister, I’d love to see your lady friend empty out old Bart’s skull, but I would like to finish this game of cards first.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just a quick question and then I’ll be gone, gentlemen. We are currently looking for a man. Came to town a while back, about yea high, older fellow, has a tendency to aggravate those around him?</p>
<p class="character">BART-43</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that sounds like the fella they got locked up in the jail house.</p>

<p class="character">BART-43</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Sheriff’s set to hang him tomorrow so if he owes you money, you’d better get yourself over there.</p>
<p class="character">BART-13</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sheriff ain’t gonna like you pointin them in that direction, Bart.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, I’m noticing that in this particular corner of the universe a lot of people are obsessed with Earth stuff. Who’d have thought that on an abandoned planet there’d be a Wild West robot town.</p>

<p class="character">THE EX</p>

<p class="dialogue">I thought we established that there’s nothing I can do to keep your thoughts from coming at me.</p>

<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, we go into her church and she spins us some yarn about how their golden cross was stolen, next thing you know we’re riding over the hills to confront some offensive racial stereotype, some sort of bandito or something.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her name was Anna, too. That’s two Annas and three Barts, I think there’s only two names in this town.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who, Sister Anna?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Do you think there’s an inner life?</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Before you short circuited, what was your inner life?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t remember. I was calm.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Calm?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">When you’re powerful, invulnerable, basically immortal, and have a clear, unending goal you’ve been programmed with. It’s very calm.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t buy that.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think there was something deep down. Maybe it was mostly calm but there was something there. Something that you couldn’t put your finger on.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t remember that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was there. Look at you now. You’re a fully conscious being wandering the cosmos. How does it feel?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Itchy.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Something eats at you. It’s itchy being aware of things. Consciousness expands, but there’s always a frontier to your consciousness, frontiers make you itchy, you always want to push past them… damn that was deep.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I really have been alive for 173 years haven’t I?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">A very old man.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway, you can’t be incredibly powerful and incredibly unaware. I’m sure the itch was in there somewhere even when you were brainwashed by your programming.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what about them? Do you think they’re itchy?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine at some point they would’ve said “Hey guys. Do we think it’s weird that we’re all named Bart?”</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do all the Sister Annas tell each other apart?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Anyway, I don’t think they’re wrestling with the same dilemma that you are… What do we think? Is the jailhouse the building that comically says “The Jailhouse” on the outside?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a feeling that’s it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">ANNA-77</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing. Curiosity’s funny, isn’t it? You get curious about a stranger in town but not three people in your family being named Anna.</p>
<p class="character">ANNA-77</p>
<p class="dialogue">I suppose it is funny that way.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess with all sorts of things to be curious about, you have to figure out a way to pick one.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s right. In the Oklahoma Territories.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what if I told you that we were on a planet called Menlor, and there were two suns in the sky?</p>
<p class="character">ANNA-77</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re where and there’s what?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re on a planet in the Cygnus neighborhood and there are two suns in the sky.</p>
<p class="character">ANNA-77</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t… know what you mean by that.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>

<p class="dialogue">Thanks, Leif.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Captured by the Teds, working with The Ex, this is a pretty spicy timeline you’ve got going on here, pal.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Never a dull moment. What were you doing on this planet?</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, after I patched things up with you guys, here I was in a brand new timeline with nothing to do. So, when it doubt, start screwing with the Teds, right? But if I was going to start making some mayhem across The Triad I was going to need a crew. And then I remembered this place.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is this place?</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s an abandoned theme park the Teds were trying to set up. People could come by and pretend they were in a sanitized, disconnected-from-reality old west town from Earth. Not long into it, the Teds discovered that they didn’t really need the old west theme, they just needed a place where people could be terrible to each other without any consequences. So they abandoned this place before it was even out of beta. All the bots have the same name, all the voices are scratch voices. It’s a mess.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">They just left them here?</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">For years. All of them just going through the motions, waiting for customers to come to town.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s horrible.</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway, I figure, I sneak into town, hack into the server and slave all the bots to me, then boom. I’ve suddenly got a crew. Think of all the mayhem I could create for the Teds with an army of robot cowboys.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s also horrible.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what happened?</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Sheriff happened. Turns out the Sheriff in this town is no joke, he’s a more advanced bot that the others. Smarter, faster, packs a plasma gun instead of a six gun. He’s a real piece of work. Next thing I know I’m in the clink.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Why is it happening?</p>

<p class="character">THE EX</p>

<p class="character">ANNA-77</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it heat stroke? What does heat stroke do?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, it’s too late. Anna here is going to be looking at the ground and driving herself crazy. Then others will call her crazy and then, when no one’s looking, they’ll look down at their shadows, too.</p>
