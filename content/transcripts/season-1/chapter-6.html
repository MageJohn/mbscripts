<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">More coffee?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, please.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, right now we are on the planet Thegrion.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A hundred years ago there was a deadly plague on Thegrion.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I also know that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">To keep the plague from spreading, they had to shut down travel for years, staying in small communities all over the planet and never interacting with each other. Eventually they found a cure, BUT-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">BUT, they had stayed separated for so many years that the isolation became ingrained in their culture. And now-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do I need to be here for this?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">AND NOW it’s an entire planet full of small towns that are suspicious of outsiders.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Except for-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">EXCEPT FOR one day a year when these communities gather together to remember the millions of people that were killed by the plague.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And on that day-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">AND ON THAT DAY every year, Midnight Burger returns to Thegrion to give some of them a place to sit and talk and drink coffee and remember.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was a lovely recitation of things I already know.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is very exciting for me, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do tell.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Midnight Burger is a chaotic place. I never know what to expect. But NOW I learn that there are things it does on a schedule. Now I know that once a year Midnight Burger comes back to Thegrion. I can plan for that. I can build a whole calendar around it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds very comforting.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">One problem.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes we come back once a year FOR THEM. But guess what WE do all the time?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Travel through time.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. So we do come back every year, but for us a year from now could be tomorrow.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s disappointing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sitting down.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t spill on my notes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey guys. Meeting at Ava’s booth?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has the food seemed alright today? It hasn’t seemed too festive has it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does festive taste like?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. It’s a global day of mourning for them and I want the food to be good but not TOO good, like it’s a party.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I haven’t heard any complaints but I also haven’t gotten any compliments.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perfect, that’s the sweet spot. Gloria, your tuna fish salad is up.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be right there... I’m going to get used to this, right?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m always going to be longing for normalcy?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yep.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then if I returned to normalcy I would get bored and long for this place?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yep.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No middle ground?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, speaking of normalcy. Something in the diner is not normal today.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, here we are on the planet Thegrion... someone in the diner is not from Thegrion.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? Who?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Table 12.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh. How Can you tell?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s trying to pass himself off as a local but I can tell.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Should I go scope him out?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why not?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have a terrible poker face.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No I don’t.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes you do.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys, what’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava depressed me so I sat down for a second.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava depresses me all the time and I remain standing.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just one more minute.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, we actually do a good job for the Thegronian... Thegreons... What did we decided we we’re calling them?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">My vote was for Thegronies but I got voted down.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re still voted down. Whatever we’re calling them, this is an important day on this planet and it’s one of the few things we do a good job on so let’s not rest on our laurels.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m getting up.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is good. This is usually the point when one of you tell me we have a problem but we’re doing okay.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have a problem.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aw, snails... What is it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone here is not one of the Thegronies.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not the name. Who is it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Table 12.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He looks like he’s from Thegrion.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s trying to blend in. It’s not working.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright, I’m going to go check on him. It’s probably nothing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thegronies.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Greetings and salutations to all of our friends here on Thegrion.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">As ever, we come to you on your day of mourning to help you through your remembrances.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is a day to remember those whom we’ve lost. And though this day of loss may loom long. Remember the psalms. Weeping may last the night, but joy... joy cometh in the morning.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys, guys. Can you tone it down a little bit? Remember last time there were a few complaints about the sermonizing?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have been put in this place to speak his truth, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also, “sermonizing” is not a word.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what the word is Zebulon, you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think what you mean is to silence the gospel.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not trying to silence the gospel.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Lord’s word transcends the earthly realm.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, okay, sure, but Jesus never made an appearance on Thegrion.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon, don’t get L. Ron Hubbard on me, no one here knows what you’re talking about when you talk about The Lord.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">All the more reason-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys. Please. I’ve got bigger fish to fry. Apparently there’s someone at table 12 that isn’t supposed to be here and I’ve got to go deal with that-</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>

<p class="dialogue">Table 12.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it, my dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, you mustn’t go to table 12.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why not?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He is here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Devil.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie. C’mon.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He is clothed in garments not his own. He comes to tempt us.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You guys are really pouring it on thick today, I don’t know what’s going on.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, my wife has never lead us astray.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, except for the time she called herself Dr. Barbara and led us into a supermassive black hole. Look, I’m going over to table 12 now and the devil is not going to be there.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what if he is there?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then I’ll get out my fiddle or something. Look, just put on some music the devil would hate and I’m going to go talk to table 12.</p>

<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello... Leif?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Been a while.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not for me. Because you are currently in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yet here I am at table 12.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And looking about 20 years older.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">23 years older.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening right now?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening right now is me ordering the Monte Cristo.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know who you are, but this is an important day for us.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to mess up your annual pity party on Thegrion. As long as you don’t mess up my sandwich. Salad on the side.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay... Coming right up.</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Psst. Caspar. What awaited you at table 12?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not the devil. Unfortunately.</p>

<p class="direction">CASPAR (CONT’D) Hey, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, how’s it going out there?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. Just, fine. Monte Cristo for table 12.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sweet, my favorite.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Side salad.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">See, why do people do that? Getting a salad is not going to erase the fact that you just ordered a deep fried ham sandwich with powdered sugar on it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Small problem. You ordered it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You ordered it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this some sort of brain teaser?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s an older version of you sitting at table 12, he just ordered your favorite sandwich. Looks like you came around on the efficacy of the side salad.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me see.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, if you see him won’t it make a wormhole or something?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like that’s the weirdest thing that’s happened in this kitchen?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good point, okay, just be careful don’t make eye contact.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why shouldn’t I make eye contact?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just let me look... Okay... That’s me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow. People should not have to see themselves 20 years in the future.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No they shouldn’t.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s he doing here? What do you think he wants?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. He seems mad about something. Like the years have not been kind.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess I make a time machine at some point?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, or at some point in the future they’re on sale and you figure “Hey why not?”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess I’ve got to go talk to him.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I doubt he’s here for the Monte Cristo. But listen, we’re on Thegrion, it’s a solemn occasion, let’s not mess it up for these people.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’ll be fine probably. Man the kitchen for a second.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know how it works back here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s on auto-pilot. I’ll be back.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s on... wait. Auto-pilot?</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: KITCHEN SOUNDS FADE. DINER FADES BACK IN.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, guys. So have you heard about our table 12 situation?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re of a particular opinion about table 12, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, hear me. Do not trust whomever sits at table 12. They are not to be trusted.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s me sitting at table 12. From the future.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh is that right? Why do you think so? Because he says he is? Because he looks like you? Do you know who can change form and speak in many tongues?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I heard you guys were on one today.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The DEVIL, Leif. That’s who. The deceiver. Trust no word from his mouth.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I may offer an explanation closer to your particular vocabulary, Leif. To many, our establishment looks like a diner but in fact is so much more. So perhaps when we are presented with a entity that both walks and talks like a duck, we should not be so quick to exclaim, “There a duck be.”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, sure. I get it. Let’s get this over with.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hello.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Monte Cristo’s coming right up. A little surprised by the side salad, I wouldn’t have made that call.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, well. Give it time.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mind if I sit?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Let’s get right to it. You’re me.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I bought it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Most places I go, time machines are illegal.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Most places WE go, Leif. But you’d know where to go if you needed one, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I suppose I would.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And so, here I am.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s so important that you had to break the law of some planet somewhere?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">In your experience, why does anyone go back in time to talk to themselves?</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about the Gold Mine?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You walked away. You could’ve been somebody, Leif but you walked away from everything. I came back here to tell you you made a mistake. It’s time to get your ass back to Earth right now.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Trying to figure out how the kitchen works. Leif said it was on auto-pilot and I thought that was an actual thing but NOTHING is happening automatically so it looks like that was just a fun joke.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where is Leif?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif is trying to discreetly handle our situation at table 12.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening at table 12... c’mon, lay it on me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take a look.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Future Leif is at table 12.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s so weird.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s bizarre.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t look away.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What is Old Leif doing here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. What would you say to yourself 20 years ago?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That Keanu Reeves will end up being the Johnny Depp you were expecting.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Neither do I.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that possible?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean “before” Leif. Leif in the before times. He’s always very cagey about his life on Earth.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You both are, by the way.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This isn’t a conversation about sharing this is a conversation about the future, being here, at table 12.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I wanted to warn you I imagine I’d just call you on the telephone under the counter rather than risk getting obliterated with everyone else.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. I’ll strike that off the list. Why are you here, then?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look. We get to know each other pretty well, you and I. I know how you feel about staying here forever if you have to. But Leif? Leif walked away from a gold mine back on Earth and wound up here. I’ve lived through the consequences of that and I’m not going to let him do it. It’s time for Leif to go home.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like... a LITERAL gold mine?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Leif was a... gold miner?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve said enough. I didn’t come here to talk to you, I came here to talk to him. Now I’m going to sit here and wait for two things. For Leif to get his head right, and for a Monte Cristo sandwich. I know this is a big day for you Caspar, why don’t you get back to taking care of the Thegronies.</p>

But if I took this incredibly useful tool and put it in the hands of a three-year-old it would just be dangerous. They convinced me that I had invented a meat cleaver on a planet full of three-year-olds. Anyway... they were going to take our research. Leave us with nothing. So I made some demands. One demand.

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We happen to be in the middle of a brunch service here.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Brunch service for a planet full of people still crying over something that happened 100 years ago? I can see why that’s important to someone like you, Caspar, but there’s bigger issues at play here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, it’s becoming clear that I share WAY too much with you in the years to come.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, I’m back. Caspar give us a minute, okay?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure, sure. Let me know if you need anything.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, you’re hilarious. Have you worked out all your little feelings yet? Can we get out of here?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s the plan exactly?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The plan is, we get on the ship I booked and go back to Earth. You revive your research and line up investors.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about the Teds?</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll handle the Teds, I know how to deal with them. You focus on erasing your screw ups.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel just fine. Oh, I’m sorry Lief, do you not like me?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Not at all.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then how about you devote the rest of your life to not ending up like me? How’s that sound?</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is he going to sing? I hope he sings.</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, the second version of you has turned out to be an intolerable fuck-face. And he is now using that fuck-facery to try and convince you to go back to Earth so that you won’t become him.</p>

<p class="dialogue">In one timeline, I’m somehow Margot Kidder.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bad dates, Indy.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And with infinite timelines upon infinite timelines, you three allegedly smart men still have a simplistic Michael J. Fox-ass concept of time travel.</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, shit.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t go back in time to talk to Leif. You went back in time to talk to A Leif, of infinite Leifs. So there’s no way to tell how he’s going to end up. Will he be bitter old Leif? Will he be even older zen-like Leif? Could be both, could be none. There’s no way of knowing. So all your attempts to influence Leif are just making more and more infinite timelines that are completely out of your control.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is there a timeline where I murder you for not mentioning this earlier?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No there isn’t, because in every timeline you are a big wuss.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So in their timeline, I don’t work here?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Correct.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t. It was just a hunch.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did I not see this?</p>
<p class="character">EVEN OLDER LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, I’ve got an excuse because I’m super old and forget things, not sure how you missed it.</p>
<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what am I supposed to do now? Just go back to my old crappy timeline and deal with it’s crappiness?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">OLD LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This sucks.</p>

For too long the people of this planet have hung their heads in pain and loss. And to what end? How long must the mourning persist. Would those who have passed on want us to say goodbye forever? And if it is forever, is it even a goodbye? Maybe it’s time for a change.
