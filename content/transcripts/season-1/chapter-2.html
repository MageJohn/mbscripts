<p class="direction">SONG: WHITE HOUSE BLUES BY CHARLIE POOLE AND THE NORTH CAROLINA RAMBLERS</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Effie, isn’t that more secular music? I thought you only did that on special occasions?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Funny you should ask that, Gloria. It stems from a fascinating conversation between my husband and I.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The crux of it being, if The Lord is master of all creation from whom all springs, is there any music that cannot praise his name?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the end, there can be no thing not praising him and deserving of his love.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cool, let me tell you about a guy named David Bowie some time, then.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, guys, huddle up, what do we think of the new girl?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think she’s great, she says my name right.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t say your name right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She says “Laef”.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what we’re saying.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s how we pronounce it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leef.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Laef.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what I’m saying.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what he just said.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Laef.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leef. I’m saying it right.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re both saying it right.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not. Gloria, how do you pronounce my name?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I say Laef but you guys say Leef. Am I saying it wrong?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I heard the same word twice, is that what you heard?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I think they’re both having a stroke.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe you’re both having a stroke.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t have a stroke, I’m too powerful.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Gloria, what are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Side work.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is side work?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Side work. Y’know before a shift starts you fill up the sugars, marry the Ketchup bottles, wipe down the tables.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, well, look at us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fancy.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know about you but I’m going to drape a white linen over my arm.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gonna go back in the kitchen, make some duck a l'orange.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to put on some high heels and order some Clams Casino.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I, for one, enjoy the air of finery that Gloria brings to our humble establishment. Honey, I think I’ll put on my good overalls.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I’ll put on my one dress that’s been in my family for a generation and has seen more funerals than an undertaker.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this a hazing? You’re making fun of the new girl?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not sure, we’ve never had a new girl before.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, what am I looking at outside the window? It’s incredible.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the curvature of space. We’re skirting around the outside of a spatial plane before settling down at a particular location.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif and I call that the “Back of the Serpent”.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because they are apparently Norse and 2000 years old.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">My brothers and sisters, we should prepare. I can feel the fibers of creation beginning to settle into place. Our arrival is imminent.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright, well I hope everyone’s finished their side work.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ha ha.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie, what are you feeling in your bones about our new destination?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The lord whispers to me of a dense and wondrous land of forests and streams, teeming with life.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds nice.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also something about teeth.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds... sharp.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">To hasten our arrival, let’s hear from the Smith’s Sacred Singers shall we?</p>
<p class="direction">SONG: SMITHS SACRED SINGERS, LIFE’S RAILWAY TO HEAVEN</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, you ready for you first shift?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pretty sure there’s no way I could be ready for this.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the spirit.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does this usually work?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like any diner. We open the door at six. Then, unlike any diner, once we open we’ll be in one of two situations: Either A) Somone needs to come in and have a seat or B) Something tries to violently kill us.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no third option?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, sometimes it’s both.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to heat up the grill.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to sit at my booth and do nothing at all.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s really beautiful.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is looking like more of an “A” situation, so that’s good.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Is that a bone?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oof. It’s heavy. It looks like a jawbone.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look at the teeth on it.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Effie was right about those too.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Was that your stomach?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was hoping it was yours.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any chance we both just imagined that at the same time?</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I forgot to drop it!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s up?</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s locked.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can anyone see anything?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s too dark.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is the sign on?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, first of all we had a whole conversation about how we need to turn the sign on when we open, secondly, turn the sign on please.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like someone put a shark’s head on top of a 12 foot emaciated corpse.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fine. We’re in here, it’s out there. We’ll wait it out and in the morning we’ll be gone and it’ll be confused then go on with it’s day.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hmm.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Hmm.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus. What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s just...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to kill both of you, what is it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know Ava was joking about it being Planet Staightforward but I mean...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s really straightforward.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A creature outside trying to get in? That’s it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No spatial distortion, no dimensional rift?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s very early-oughts horror movie. There’s a thing in the woods and it’s killing people and no one will belive you. That sort of thing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Starring Justin Long.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, and like, Kate Bosworth.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who cares?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe what our compatriots are attempting to convey is that our current predicament on its face is the picture of simplicity.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And perhaps if we sat with that simplicity for a moment, we would begin to observe complexities within complexities.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Mona Lisa is simply a picture of a nice lady. But look closer and there is a universe within.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what? We’ve got to figure this out or something?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe it bears a closer look.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s too boring.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys, I would really like a night off.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, but it’s too booooooring.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wouldn’t a night off be nice, though?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But it’s my first night.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok. Let me counter offer. How about we NOT figure it out and instead Leif makes... Night Breakfast.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oooh. Night Breakfast.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The temptation is strong. For Night Breakfast is forbidden.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Truly food that is syrup-ed belongs in the day. And yet, from time to time, one finds oneself presented with a pile of waffles when the moon is high, a scoop of whipped butter melting atop them.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to lie, that sounds straight-up erotic but maybe Leif’s right. Maybe we should figure out what the deal is with this horrific thing outside and THEN have Night Breakfast, as a reward.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Fine. But then after Night Breakfast we are playing a game of dice in the walk-in.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You currently owe me 2800 dollars from dice in the walk in.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes but what if this time I’m in the zone?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re never in the zone.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys, focus. I’m hungry now. Ava, do some science, what the deal with this thing?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, I’m not a Zoologist. You know what we called the Zoologists back in school? Poop-lookers. You want to know why?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because they looked at a lot of poop?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because they looked at a lot of poop.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is everyone being goofy right now?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because the situation was supposed to be either A: We have customers or B: Something tries to kill us. A: There are no customers, and B: The thing that’s trying to kill us very obviously can’t get in here to kill us. It’s like a snow day.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here, I’ll start it off. There’s a thing outside. It’s huge and ugly. It wants to get in here to eat us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s an assumption you’re making.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am making that assumption because it’s mouth is full of teeth and the size of a manhole cover. What else would you use that mouth for?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need an option for comparison. There’s a huge jawbone on the floor that obviously comes from one of the same species, maybe it wants that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would it want that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It would have to be a known unknown - we know that we don’t know it but we know there’s something to know.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But applying Occam’s Razor, what’s the most logical reason why a monster whose mouth looks like it’s full of can-openers wants to get in here?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">True, but Occam’s razor can quite often be a refuge for bedwetters. Are you a bedwetter, Caspar? Because I have my suspicions.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are all Physicists mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know who Occam is but I think you’re saying that the most likely thing has got to be true, but since we’re trying to, y’know, look deeper, maybe we shouldn’t go with the obvious thing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Agreed.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long are we going to do this for? Can we have a time limit?</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where’s it going? You think it lost interest?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I know I have.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is kind of hard to find the nuance here. I think it’s just a creature and this is Planet Straightforward.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what I say. We don’t have to do a full investigation into this. It’s a big monster. Who cares? Sometimes a monster is just a monster.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So true. You know who else said that, Husband?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who was that, Honey?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Trojans. “Oh, look, a beautiful wooden horse they have given us as a gift. Let’s not look into it too much.”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What could possibly go wrong?”</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What perturbs you?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was thinking... One time, when I ran a restaurant, I buried a whole pig in the ground with hot coals for 36 hours and then used it to cater a wedding. It was delicious. And the pig that I used did not look half as delicious as the Pig-Panda outside. And it’s not getting eaten.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t have to explain to a couple of Arkasawyers the importance of a roasted pig, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ahh. Sweet Pansy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa, you ATE Pansy.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I grew up on a pig farm outside of Bald Knob and on a pig farm the pigs are your friends until... until their solemn duty calls.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yikes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, I’m afraid we have a confession to make.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can tell you the story of the ravenous creature outside.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You knew this whole time?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Lord had told us its story.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why didn’t you say anything?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Caspar was running around in his pissy-pants.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we do so enjoy watching his knickers get very tightly twisted.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We had every intention of telling you during Night Breakfast.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. So what’s the story?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The creature outside is not one of God’s creations. The creature has its own maker.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone made that thing?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We know not who. It’s creator has long since passed into the beyond, leaving behind an entire race of creatures such as this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why were they made?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’d think to create creatures such as this one would have to have a sharpened purpose.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yet these creatures were only made because they could be made. A flight of fancy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t look happy.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. It is not. For this terrible creature has an even more terrible curse.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The reason why our delightful Pig-Panda visitor has not been eaten, is because this creature only craves the flesh of its own kind.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God. They’re cannibals?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, now a cannibal has a choice doesn’t he? This creature can eat nothing else.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It spends its life hunting down its own kind?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Or being hunted, yes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">To turn your own kind into your enemy. It is truly a sin.</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right, my dear.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What a horrible life it must have.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is a life without brotherhood or solidarity. A life of enmity. I would imagine, a life where one prays for an ending, but with no creator to pray to.</p>
