<p class="direction">SFX: SILENCE IN THE DINER EXCEPT FOR THE PULSATING BIG, MALEVOLENT THING. FROM THE PARKING LOT WE CAN HEAR THE OCCASIONAL ZAP OF AN ARC WELDER.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had a friend who went crazy one time. Me and my girlfriends we all made a deal that when we graduated from high school, we would get the hell out of Tucson. So we did. We all went to Phoenix, two and a half hours away but it felt like the other side of the world. I got a job at a, ooof, I got a job at a Jack in the Box. That was rough. But it was my new life in a new city, that was nice. Anyway, one friend of mine never made it out. Rosa. She just stayed with her parents, could never really pull the rip chord. She just got stuck. She was always a little weird. So, one day, years later, one of my girlfriends says “Hey, did you hear about Rosa? She moved to Needles?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know if you know anything about Needles but it’s a perfect blend of small town and abandoned train yard. One hundred and twenty degrees there in the summer. And there’s little tiny bugs crawling all over everything there. I don’t even know what they are, just these little black dots moving around on the surface of everything, no matter where you go. You ask someone about the bugs and they just say “Oh, yeah, happens sometimes.” That’s it.</p>
<p class="dialogue">One weekend I drove up there to see her. I don’t know why, I just had to know what happened. She didn’t even have an address, she was living out of a camper van. Selling handmade souvenirs on the roadside. She would go into the desert and look for animal skulls, which there was a lot of, because it was 120 degrees and everything was dying. She’d take these sun bleached skulls and lay them out on a Navajo blanket across the street from a truck stop. She kind of made a killing, actually.</p>
<p class="dialogue">We sat there outside her camper van and we drank a bottle of tequila as the sun went down. We were in our twenties at that point but she had been out in that sun so long she looked like she was fifty. Cracks everywhere on her face.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I asked her “Rosa, what happened?!</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d you end up in fucking Needles selling skulls across from a truck stop?”</p>
<p class="dialogue">“I was stuck, Gloria. I didn’t know what to do. So I thought I’d just do the craziest thing.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">And here I am, lightyears from home, and my shitty stories from Arizona are still relatable.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I really am sorry.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been floating here for three days, Ava. You’ve been saying you’re sorry for three days.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I tried to explain to you why-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s the “trying” part I have a problem with. You haven’t succeeded yet.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I told you-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you know why you haven’t succeeded? Because you don’t know why you did it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie told me-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, right, you keep saying that, “Effie told me to.” Can you think of a less reliable source of information than Effie and Zebulon? They thought they were sportscasters one time, remember that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know they’re not reliable, that’s why I did it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t care what it means, you just want to be pissed at me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do just want to be pissed at you!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I’ll shut up and you can be pissed at me!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What the hell is Leif making in the parking lot?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, him and Caspar have some kind of plan, it’s probably stupid... That’s a significant parking lot for me. You convinced me to stay while we stood in that parking lot. Remember that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We smoked a cigarette in 14 million BC, you showed me twenty foot tall mushrooms, and said “You should stay.”</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I remember.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe shut up next time.</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we’re ready, come on.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar-</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, let’s go see what new bullshit this is.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: DOOR CHIME. THE SOUND OF THE BIG, MALEVOLENT, THING GROWS LOUDER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, first of all, don’t judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well what should I judge it by?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your first question is going to be “Is this made from kitchen appliances?” The answers is “No, not entirely.”</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it a robot?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a suit.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A suit for what?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... you know how sometimes plans evolve and then you look back and think “Whoa, how did we get here?”</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh God, a suit for what?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re shooting Ava into space.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Well look at that, I didn’t freak out. I’m guess I’m used to things now.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know it sounds crazy-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously, Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Before we start yelling. There’s an explanation.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re that pissed at me?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m extraordinarily pissed at you-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s an explanation. Ava, we are not condemning you to The Phantom Zone, there’s a reason for this.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I bet it’s a great one.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re on the edge of this big, malevolent thing, right? The gravitational pull has got to be massive, but we’re staying still. Also, it’s giving off a repeating radio signal.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything gives off a repeating radio signal.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a repeating radio signal that’s spelling out your name in American morse code.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa... so that big thing out there is asking for Ava?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And very deliberately not taking us all into it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is no way I’m getting in that thing.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We tested it, it works fine.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t give a shit, you’re out of your mind.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what you wanted, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">To be launched into space in something made from a Cuisinart? No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’s dangerous?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s funny, I don’t remember you consulting us on wether or not we’d like to be put in danger.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not the same thing.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s the same thing, I’ve decided it’s the same thing. Isn’t that frustrating, when someone decides something important without asking you?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I’d be worried about it too if I didn’t build this rig myself. It’s very safe. I know it looks kind of like a trash monster but it’s got an air recycler, on-board guidance systems, it’s got its own thrusters.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thrusters. Made from what?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cooking spray cans, but look, thrust is thrust. The gravity will do most of the work.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what’s the plan for getting me back? Or are you all planning to sacrifice me to the great volcano in the sky?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We didn’t have a plan to get out of the supermassive black hole, you weren’t worried then.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes but-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But what? How is this different?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s different is you want me to get in that thing!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava. I’m sorry, you’ve got to get in the suit.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we in this mess because of you? Yes or no?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I’m sorry. You break it, you buy it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck that. Look, I know everyone’s pissed at me and wants me to suffer somehow but that doesn’t mean you get to turn me into Voyager 2.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we please all just stay calm and trust that a solution will come to us? There has to be one less ridiculous than this one.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hi, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are next on my list of people to kill.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again, it’s going to be fine. It’s a very safe suit.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why can’t I move the arms?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not fully powered up yet.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do I want to know what you’re powering this thing with? Is it Crisco?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Though now that you mention it vegetable oil is an interesting choice for deep space combustion. Doesn’t have to be pressurized and it’s non- flammable.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had to do something.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t have to do anything. But now I have to do something. So I’m going to use this hand truck, wheel you to the edge of the parking lot, and jettison you into space. Leif says the suit will take over once you hit zero G.</p>

<p class="dialogue">So we decided to get creative. We’re using everything we’ve got to send one last broadcast of the message in the hopes that we can reacquire the signal.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh shit! Radio telescope!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Excuse me?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Effie and Zebulon Mucklewain. Do those names mean anything to you?</p>
<p class="character">WILLOW</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those are my grandparents.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes they were, weren’t they?</p>
<p class="character">WILLOW</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Daniel, does Willow tell a lot of stories about her grandparents?</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">All the time. What’s going on?</p>

<p class="dialogue">How do you know all this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF-LET</p>
<p class="dialogue">Boss, we’ve got fluctuations.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. There’s no time. Guys, listen to me. It’s all explained in my notes.</p>
<p class="character">WILLOW</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can’t read your notes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re written in Groote. It’s a 19th century Dutch shorthand. Google it. Fuck! You can’t. The past sucks! Look it up somehow.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">The transformer is going to blow any second now.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This signal, this Arecibo message, you have to keep broadcasting it.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can’t, we’re almost out of juice and we’re about to get fired.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good. Get fired. People won’t understand what you’re doing anyway. Find a way to broadcast it.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can’t get this much power or facilities like this.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, you’re thinking about it wrong. It’s not about the strength of the signal it’s about the number of iterations in space/time that you’re broadcasting it. Think of it like triangulating a location. The longer you send the signal the more data you’ll get from us and vice versa.</p>
<p class="character">WILLOW</p>
<p class="dialogue">Us?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys, the signal you sent into the sky, it was idiotic.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">We agree.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Something heard it. Something heard it, but it doesn’t understand you. It’s trying to. Goddamn... like two lovers in the dark; stumbling towards each other, hoping for skin. You have to keep broadcasting.</p>
<p class="character">WILLOW</p>
<p class="dialogue">We will.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">We will?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF-LET</p>
<p class="dialogue">Boss, here comes another one.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re going to need funding. Nobody’s going to be crazy enough to fund this. Shit. Oh! It’s 1976?</p>
<p class="character">WILLOW</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ha! Take all the money you have and invest in Apple Computers. Trust me, you’ll never have to write a grant again.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">TRUST ME. Willow, I know your grandparents. Kind of. They would want you to have faith. Oh shit. Oh shit, something’s happening. Remember everything I’ve said. Read my notes! Don’t stop the signal!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Shit. What’s the plan?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF-LET</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to have to put you to sleep again, Boss. It’s the only way to conserve oxygen. We put you to sleep, do one last burn toward the diner, and hope for the best.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are our chances?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF-LET</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You guys. I figured it out. I mean kind of. Some of it, anyway. I couldn’t figure it out because... because it’s like trying to recognize if someone’s lying to you when you’re lying to them at the same time. When you’re going too fast on the freeway, and so is everyone else, it’s harder to know that you’re speeding.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shh. Just let me get this out. I’ve been trying to figure it out, but it’s been trying to figure us out at the same time.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What has?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The diner?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, no, not the diner. Something else. This is where it tries to reach out, where it tries to get to know us. It was right in front of my face. If you want to get to know someone, you find a place that’s safe. Where maybe you can have a cup of coffee and get to know each other. But here’s the problem: what if you’re a human and want to get to know an ant? You don’t know what it’s like to be an ant, you can’t “speak ant” even though you’re hundreds of thousands of times more intelligent than an ant. So what do you do?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, you need to stop-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You try a lot of things, mostly you stay out of the way and watch. Sometimes you’ll make sure nothing happens to your new friend. And if you get worried that your new friend is alone and afraid... you make it friends.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie and Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you don’t know how to make a friend. You don’t even know what “friend” means. So you reach out for whatever you’ve got. You hear stories told by an astronomer about her grandparents, and how they were people that made her feel safe. And in your ham-fisted way try and make them.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So Effie and Zebulon are simulations or something?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Because you’re not an ant, you’re a person, and you’re so smart that you’re an idiot. And without meaning to, you make a person. Two people.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">An artificial intelligence?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif-</p>
