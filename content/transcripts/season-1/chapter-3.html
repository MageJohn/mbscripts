<p class="dialogue">Leif are you back there?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, what’s up?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know where we are right now but I’m getting all kinds of crazy orders and I don’t know what to do with them.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s looking like Harlan County, Kentucky. About 1934-ish.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that explains why the sexism AND the racism are jumping out. I don’t know what’s happened more times, me getting my ass grabbed or someone calling me “Señorita”.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">These are all striking coal miners, if it makes you feel any better half of these guys are going to have their legs broken by a Pinkerton by the end of the week.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That does not make me feel better at all.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, too dark?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look they’re ordering Mutton, Burgoo, and something called a Hot Brown.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I’ve got that. How many Hot Brown?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seven all day. Where is Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Emergency inventory. We’re having some serious stock issues.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright, brothers and sisters, this is Calamity Jane comin’ to you from Union Radio USA. Union or die!</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just remember when you’re toiling out there on the picket line: when the coal stops, they freeze, when the bosses go on strike, nobody notices a goddamn thing! This next one is a classic. I want to hear you singing from the Hood to the Holler, and remember: at least the President knows your boss is a son of a bitch!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">In situations such as these my wife and I tend to play along so as not to spook the yokels.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Got it. Who is Calamity Jane?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a radio personality my wife will adopt from time to time of a hard drinking and swearing populist. It’s very sinful but the Lord does tend to forgive, and she does tend to enjoy it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you enjoy it a little bit, too?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your secret’s safe with me, Pastor. Where’s Ava?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava also finds herself at home in such hardscrabble environs. I imagine there’ll be a sing along any time now.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Sheesh. I haven’t worked a shift like that in years.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Coal miners rule. They all smell like brimstone.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, emergency inventory is done. Gloria, sorry I left you alone, did it go okay?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You owe my feet an apology.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I apologize to your feet, but the walk-in is in crisis mode and we need to go shopping.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shopping spree!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was going to ask about that. How do you restock? Do you just wait for a location with a grocery store?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The walk-in magically regenerates stock on its own but it regenerates at random. Sometimes we have to do some emergency shopping until we get a new quote-unquote delivery.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Same with the deep-freeze?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t like to talk about the deep-freeze. Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’ve got cash here. Are you doing dry goods or produce?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll do dry goods, you do produce and meat.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Awesome. 1934 Kentucky? There’s going to be some amazing lard out there.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have 1934 American currency just laying around?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I make it with the pasta maker.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow. Health code violation.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Give me money.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are you going?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m headed over to the old-timey tobacconist to buy some smokey treats. Hopefully he’ll refer to it as “tabaki”.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, do you want some money?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I’ve had enough local flavor for one day, I’m going to put my feet up.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I think we’ve got about four hours until we lift off. Don’t get left behind, guys.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Baby, how long are we going to do this? I feel like I haven’t seen you for weeks.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ricky, I can’t let up now. Things are happening, it’s going really well.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s going well for you, how about us?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It usually takes two years for a restaurant to turn a profit. We’re turning a profit after six months.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">We didn’t even need the money.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, what is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do you think I worked so hard to get a promotion? So I could support you guys.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Miracle of miracles, the old-timey tobacconist is also the moonshine guy. His mentally slow son will be delivering three jugs any minute now.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Why are you back so soon?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been gone for an hour.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Something weird just happened.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Lovely. What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A woman came in and said she was looking for Caspar and then before I knew it I was arguing with her like she was Ricky, my possessive ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh fucking hell.</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: DOOR CHIME</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, produce is on the way. I hope everyone likes rhubarb, it’s going to be in every dish for a while.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What? Shit. What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell him what you told me.</p>

<p class="dialogue">A woman came in and I started arguing with her like she was my ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh fucking hell.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who is she?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A pain in my ass, is who she is.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t know who she is. She comes around every once and a while and makes our lives hell.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We started calling her The Ex.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s some sort of trans-dimensional being. When you interact with her she takes on the persona of your most prominent Ex and you have no choice but to argue with her.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s the universal embodiment of all exes.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Right?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is she dangerous?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just interminable.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. That’s really annoying but It’s fine, right? I mean, I’ve argued with Ricky nine thousand times before, what’s one more?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s complicated.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar is terrified of her.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So am I.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I mean it’s bad. He kind of loses it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa. What’s going on there?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody knows.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you tried asking?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">When she comes by we pretend we’re a dysfunctional Midwestern family and just don’t talk about it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s that bad?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Watch.</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: DOOR CHIME</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay I got flour, cornmeal, and salt but he was out of sugar which is surprising considering the state of the teeth in this town.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s back.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s back?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where is she?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t know. She did a drive-by on Gloria and then walked out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">She could be fucking anywhere, then.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but we know she’ll end up here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course she’ll end up here, she’s a goddamn emotional terrorist!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s going to be fine-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lock the doors. Did we lock the doors?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve tried that before, locked doors don’t stop her.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, okay. Let’s just sit here then and let this psychopath pick away at us, what a great idea!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ll keep her away from you, okay?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not just me! It’s not just me, it’s all of us! She traumatizes all of us!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, to varying degrees.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t you start with me!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m putting you in the walk-in.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, lock the doors. Board up the doors! Have we tried that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get in there. Go.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long are we going to endure this shit? Seriously, have we tried lamb’s blood on the doors?!</p>
<p class="direction">SFX: WALK-IN DOOR CLOSES. CASPAR HEARD RANTING FROM BEHIND THE DOOR.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow. I’m going to steer clear of that.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good idea.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well shit, okay, what happens now?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Misery. We wait here, she comes by at random and we try and keep her away from Caspar until she loses interest and leaves.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Isn’t that what exes do? They show up, acting casual, then you realize they want to rehash some argument that they never got emotional gratification for and then when they realize they’re not going to get that gratification they suddenly have a plane to catch or something.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there, y’all. We’re back and feeling refreshed, what did we miss?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Ex is back.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aw, snails.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again with this abomination?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where’s Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava locked him in the walk-in.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good lookin’ out.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what though? Caspar’s right. This woman is an emotional terrorist and we shouldn’t have to put up with this bullshit.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe “terrorist” is overstating it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it? She strikes at random and provokes overblown responses.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we’ve tried everything at this point, Leif, I think we just have to eat it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been thinking about her, though.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, Lord.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That always goes well.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We keep calling her a trans-dimensional being but what if she’s not?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is she instead?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A construct. Like an A.I..</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone made an Ex-Bot?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would someone do that?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that’s a whole other line of questioning, my question is, if you were a trans-dimensional entity would you really spend all of your time confronting people about their failed relationships?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re saying because of her narrow agenda, her existence has to be deliberate somehow?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what I’m saying.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hm. So let’s say you’re right. Let’s say some mad scientist somewhere made an Ex-Bot to wander the multi-verse and get into other peoples’ business. God knows why someone would do that but they also made six Transformers movies so...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does that change what we do?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I say, if she’s an emotional terrorist it’s time for us to, y’know, drone strike a wedding.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, Leif, again-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, too dark again, what I mean is let’s go on the offensive.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We support you in your endeavors, Leif, but what are the steps to this particular square-dance?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It would start with you two. Effie, Zebulon, how old were you two when you met?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon was eleven and I had just turned twelve.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’ve never been with anyone else, right?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">No we have not. We were affianced upon my fifteenth birthday and we have been together ever since, for our marriage is made strong my a singular truth.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That divorce is an abomination.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that we love each other very much.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, also that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So when she walks in I want you guys to hit her with the story of how you met and fell in love. People without exes would be outside of her parameters and she would need to recalibrate. While she’s distracted we all go at her, all at the same time.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go at her how?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t wait for her to argue with us, we start arguing with her like she’s our ex. All of us at the same time.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want to try and overload her processor.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If your theory is correct and she has one.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m telling you, I’m right about this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that going to be enough?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s worth a shot. But listen, we’ve really got to go for it, though. All the things you wanted to say to your ex but never did? Let it all hang out, get uncomfortable with it because she’s not going to hold back on us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">God, this is going to suck.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s going to be terrible.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, remind me to give thanks to Jesus for never having to date.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ll remind each other.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we together on this? I feel like we have a plan.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I don’t want to.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, if this works, we’ll never have to deal with this nonsense again. Are we in?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re in.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re glad to help however we can, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Good. Have there been any sightings of her since first contact?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s keep our eyes out the window so we can see her coming.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I really was having a good day.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I liked escaping my old life. Now, here it comes again.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going on across the street?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it a party or something?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not a party, that’s a bar fight.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, that’s got to be her.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Definitely her brand of chaos.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did you break up?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because his name was Chad but his personality was also named Chad, know what I mean?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We actually broke up twice. I was working at Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the time, we were having a party and needed a cake. I snuck into his bakery and stole one and that somehow led to us having to break up again even though we had already broken up.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">I can still remember the day I first saw you. How the mountains split the clouds like the shears of a dressmaker. I sat atop the pig shelter, having just visited with my favorite sow, Pansy, when you and your Daddy crested the nearby hills. You were silhouetted by the morning sun. It was the rest of my life headed towards me, though I would never know it.</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was different that morning, when I awoke. Our fathers had business to discuss and with my mother visiting her ailing sister in Booneville I knew I must accompany him. As we headed out the door my father asked “Honey, where is Maybelle?” Maybelle was my dolly, and I had not been without her at my side since I was given her at the age of six. Yet, for some reason that morning I had left Maybelle behind. It was the first time I could feel a change in the air.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was so nervous as she approached. I turned to Pansy and said “Pansy, my girl, what am I to say to her if she speaks to me? I’ve never seen someone like her.”</p>
