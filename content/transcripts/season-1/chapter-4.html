<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, for a while it was just me and them. Before you showed up, before Ava. A long time ago I walked into what I thought was a diner in... where was I? Bakersfield. I walked into an abandoned diner and suddenly the old-timey radio next to the cash register started talking to me. And I thought, “Okay the radio’s talking to me, my psychotic break has arrived, this’ll be fun.” But then, 24 hours later, I was on Garrion.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">People don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway. I saw some weird shit before you guys showed up. And I was glad that they were there for me. I depended on them. When you literally don’t have ground beneath your feet, other things become the ground. And when those things fail too, where does that leave you? Things are supposed to work. I like it when things work.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, for all we know, Ava is right and this is part of their plan. Maybe things keep working, they just don’t work in the way we expect them to.</p>
