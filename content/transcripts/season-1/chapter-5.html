<p class="direction">SONG: SHE’S COMING AROUND THE MOUNTAIN BY HENRY WHITTER</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, what are you doing over there?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, nothing. Just hanging out with my good friends Effie and Zebulon Mucklewain.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, you seem to be lurking suspiciously close to the radio when you are usually ensconced within your booth.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice change of pace never hurt anyone.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And this has nothing to do with our little outage we had yesterday?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to need air-quotes the size of Mr. Snuffleupagus put around the word “outage”.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, sometimes she speaks and I don’t understand a word she’s saying.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a consequence of ladies attending college.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um, whoa.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We accidentally changed the station on you guys and the diner stopped working, any insight into that?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure we don’t have any light to shed, but I would like to congratulate you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">On what?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve often said that you don’t understand how this diner of yours works, and now you’ve figured it out, it seems.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have NOT figured it out.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then my curiosity doth rise. If you say you haven’t the foggiest notion how the diner works, well, how then would you know when it is NOT working?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the kitchen)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ha ha, owned, Ava.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes, my love?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Prepare. We are drifting into the nether realms.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my. Do take heed, my compatriots. The nether realms approach.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that? Are we in the nether realms?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus. What is this now?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alternate Earth timeline. They call it the nether realms because they’re fancy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, is this going to be like “Sliders”?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God, are you a Sliders fan?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huge Sliders fan.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Favorite episode, go.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um, um, um. Oh! The one where the US is at war with Australia.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That one was dope. Guess mine.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ummmm, the one where Rembrandt is Elvis!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes! That one was amazing!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, how are we all doing?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Quick update-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I heard everything. Ava got owned, headed toward the nether realms.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Gloria, alternate timeline Earths can be rough. Try and go with the flow.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s so rough about them?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been to a bunch of alternate Earths at this point and consistently it is always WAY WORSE than the Earth we’re from.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey there. Welcome to Midnight Burger.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. How’s your night going?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Um, fine, thank you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m Caspar. That’s Gloria. Leif’s back in the kitchen. That’s Ava over there, though she probably won’t say much as she’s still recovering from being wrong about something a few minutes ago.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Keep digging, Buddy.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are your ads?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry?</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">You just said several sentences without an ad, are you ad-free, you don’t look ad-free. I thought the fees were so high only a select few could afford them. This confused line of questioning is brought to you by Delta. Delta, setting the standard for safer travel.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, my.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, here’s some coffee. Have you decided on anything, or do you need a few minutes? I’d recommend the BLT, mainly because it’s hard to screw up.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going on here? Is this some sort of sting operation? I won’t give up my people, no matter what you do, this act of defiance is brought to you by Huggies-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ma’am, ma’am, ma’am, everything’s okay. Nobody’s going to hurt you. We don’t know what’s going on, though, can you explain to us why you’re upset?</p>

<p class="dialogue">No, you first, where are your ads?</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Syrup. Land of syrup so we don’t know what you’re talking about right now.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Canada? So it’s true what they say? There’s no mandatory ads in Canada? I thought that was propaganda? This glimmer of hope is brought to you by Doc Martens, now offering free shipping on all orders over 50 dollars.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s definitely true, what they say about Canada. In fact, to three people who are very certainly from Canada, you sound a little strange right now.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure I do. I haven’t sounded like myself for several years. But you have to forgive me, I don’t have any way of stopping it. This painful admission is brought to you by Twix.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that was Insufficient Sweetie by Ukulele Ike. Folks, it occurs to us that there may be some of you out there that are a bit confused as to where you may find yourself.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Indeed. Perhaps you find yourself in a land where folks’ words are not their own. Where they are forced to speak in avaricious tongues to appease a sinful overlord.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And perhaps The Lord has put you in this land to help them escape their oppressors, if you catch my meaning..</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, guys. We got it. Subtle.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your radio doesn’t have ads either.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, it’s a... Canadian radio station.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">They don’t sound Canadian.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And some of you may be thinking to yourself, what’s a couple of Arkansawyers doing way up in Canada? It’s a very interesting story.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is indeed, Dearest. It began when I was a boy and I had a pet pig named Pansy-</p>

<p class="dialogue">What’s your name?</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mary.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mary, since we’re from Canada. Right, Leif? That’s where we’re from is Canada?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, that’s right. Go Raptors.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We really don’t understand what’s going on. What’s with the tin foil around your neck?</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">It blocks the GPS signal.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. You know what? Why don’t you start from the beginning?</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course. To you I must sound like a crazy person. I’ll start at the beginning. Our economy had begun to fail. With so many jobs being automated, no one could find something to support themselves. Nobody was safe. Jobs you wouldn’t think could be automated suddenly were being done by an algorithm and a robot. I can’t remember the last time a human being took my order at a restaurant. With everyone’s job being replaced, there were protests. Protests turned to riots. Then the corporations who had replaced the workers unveiled their plan to save the working class: Ad space. You could get a direct payment from a corporation if you agreed to put a billboard on your garage door or on the roof of your car. Any empty space would do, the back of your jacket, the side of your purse. It worked for a while, but soon we discovered that the empty spaces on our homes and clothing weren’t enough. People had to take drastic actions. Product-specific tattoos began to fetch a high price. Students were told their college debt would be forgiven if they legally changed their name to Sprite or Boboli Bread Shell. In the end even that wasn’t enough.</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s when they began to offer the chips. They’re embedded into the back of our neck and weave advertisements directly into our conversations without us being able to control it. Before long the chips became mandatory. The ads are everywhere now, even in the words we say to a loved one.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need to apologize in advance. After a lengthy explanation like this, I’ll probably have to do a 15 second spot.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sunlight travels 93 million miles to turn our grapes into Sun Maid raisins, and that’s all we put in. Grapes and sunshine. Sun Maid raisins, nothing but grapes and sunshine.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok... Ava could we talk to you over here real quick?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure. Ava crossing the room is brought to you by Nestle’s Quick-</p>

<p class="dialogue">I just wanted to have a quick meeting to confirm that this is the stupidest dystopia we’ve ever been to.</p>

<p class="dialogue">So bad.</p>

<p class="character">OFFICER VALVOLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice to meet you. Folks, I don’t mind telling you that the woman I’m looking for this evening is very dangerous. As you know, ads are life, and this woman and the group she belongs to are attempting to subvert this way of life and send this city and this country into total chaos. The Getty Foundation is proud to support this malevolent warning.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Total chaos sounds bad.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is she a terrorist or something?</p>
<p class="character">OFFICER VALVOLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She most certainly is. She belongs to a group known as Free Ad-Free. They believe it’s their human right to be free of advertisements. Her and her compatriots are constantly searching for ways to have their chips removed and deny the community of the valuable revenue that they generate.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">OFFICER VALVOLINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Luckily for them, they’ve been largely unsuccessful. As we all know, removing a chip is very dangerous. There’s risk of infection, neurological damage, also it explodes.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey, Mary. While they’re doing whatever they’re doing let’s focus on something else.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d really like that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why were you on the run?</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a stupid idea. I heard there was someone in this part of town that could remove my chip. I was going to have my chip removed and then broadcast a speech. I had a shortwave radio and everything. I was going to talk to people without interruption. Without ads. I wanted to be able to remind people what it was like.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not much of a plan.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t know what else to do. Do you have any idea how terrible it is to say something heartfelt to someone you love and have to follow it up with an ad for Heineken? This mention of an ad for Heineken brought to you by Heineken.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, how’s it coming back there?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It appears to run on some form of electricity.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, come on.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys, scientists have fields of study for a reason. We’re not wizards.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are those heat-sinks?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are they what?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those two squares right there, they’re heat-sinks. That means it can overheat.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know how to get it off. Mary, I’m sorry for how this question sounds but would you mind if I applied a Crème Brûlée torch to the explosive on the back of your neck?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If it has heat-sinks that means it can overheat. If it overheats it will shut down until it cools off. So I can remove it, but only for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know that?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just trust me. The chip comes off, I throw it out in the street before it explodes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am not in support of that.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I have to keep the chip. I have to stand in solidarity with my fellow freedom fighters.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ug. Activists are the worst.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I meant to make the speech and then put the chip back on.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that complicates things.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The chip is one thing. What about the broadcast she wanted to make?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do we have to give her the whole package? We can’t just take the chip off?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She wants to put it back on.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We could maybe do a broadcast from here.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really? And how are we going to do that?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’d have to take the radio apart.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, come again?</p>

<p class="dialogue">How would you do it?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">In an older transistor radio, I might be able to use the local oscillator to transmit a low power AM signal. I MIGHT be able to connect the audio amplifier input to be the speaker instead of the detector diode. The audio output MIGHT power the local oscillator rather than being directly powered by the battery.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How would you modulate the amplitude?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her voice in the local oscillator hopefully.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’d be hard to do without an oscilloscope.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Or a circuit map. But radios like that are so old, I could probably just wing it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have we met?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just go with it, Mary.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is all assuming that when I open up the back of the radio that... there’s a radio in there.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, you want to dial it back just a little bit?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. She’s right, though I am loath to admit it. If this radio that we speak through can be of help to this troubled lady in her troubled world then we are obliged to offer assistance. Leif, do what you must.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No no. No no no. No. We’re not touching the radio again, not after the black hole.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">After the what?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, you must have faith that the Lord has put us on this path.</p>

<p class="dialogue">My husband is right. We must have faith.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I LOVE the Lord.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on, though. If our plan is to remove her chip so she can make a speech into the radio, we still need to do something with her chip. It’ll blow if it’s off her for... more than five seconds, I’m guessing.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, you’ve got an audience.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mary. Fear not. Step forward and speak.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Hello. My name is Mary. I... I studied anthropology in school. In Boston. At first I didn’t even know why, I just felt like I should. I think I wanted to know... I wanted to know how we got here. How did we go from strange, confused apes to this? It was a question I had always asked myself and was always confused why more people didn’t ask it.</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do people walk around in their lives and not ask how they got there? I thought it made me weird but my dad said to me “It doesn’t make you weird, it makes you an anthropologist.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">I... I don’t know why I brought that up. I think it’s because... That was the first thing I asked my professor my freshman year: “How did we get here?” And I suppose I was expecting an hour-long speech or something but she just said... She just said, “we started living together.” And then she gestured to the Boston skyline and said, “And that led to all of this.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">The thing is... I don’t think this is what we meant to do. All of this. When we huddled together for warmth thousands of years ago I don’t think this was where we were trying to get to. I think we meant to do something else. I don’t know what we meant to do, but let me ask you something? When you look around, do you see something done right, or something done wrong? I know what that answer is for me. I think you owe it to yourselves to find your answer. You won’t hear from me again. But try and think of me from time to time, if you can.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was lovely, Mary.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">A sermon for the ages, to be sure.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, thank you so much. But Caspar looks miserable. I think you should put my chip back on.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mary, if you like I can keep wearing this chip until Leif figures out what to do with it, you can at least have some time without ads being piped into your brain. This selfless offer is brought to you by Clorox Clean-up holy fucking shit I hate this thing.</p>
<p class="character">MARY</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fine. They’ll just put another one on me anyway. That chip and I have been through a lot together.</p>
