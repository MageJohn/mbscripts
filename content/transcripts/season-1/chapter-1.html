<p class="dialogue">So you saw an ad telling you to come here at 6?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well it said “all applicants” but looks like it’s just me. Can I ask? Did you make the ad? Because it seems to me that no one else works here, but you seem surprised that I showed up. Do you own this place?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, look. I don’t have time for this. You obviously had no idea I was coming and you seem to have no idea what you’re doing. I’m broke. And miserable. And for you to add your irresponsibly unprepared interview to that is the slap in the face I don’t have time for.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait wait wait. I’m sorry. You’re right. I didn’t know you were coming. Management never tells me these things. How about you... tell me about yourself?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. My name’s Gloria. I’ve been in food service my whole life. I had a taquieria for a while but the pandemic shut it down. Don’t have the money to start it back up again so now... Now, I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m doing. I saw the ad, and for some reason a diner out in the middle of nowhere sounded like a good idea.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any family in the picture or...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Mom and Dad passed away, I was an only child so it’s just me.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s great! That’s, I mean, I’m sorry about that, that’s... my condolences. Can you tell me about the ad?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Management doesn’t really tell you anyhting, do they?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">They don’t.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s weird that you say “management”.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well it’s one diner outside of Phoenix, it’s not a Red Robin.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is weird. I should stop doing that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway. It was an ad in Craigslist. Not a lot of restaurants are hiring right now so it stood out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well how did you end up working here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Just sort of walked in, looking for a place to be, but that was a long time ago.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure. Sure. Sure. I’m Caspar. And I pretty much do everything around here since our cook unexpectedly left a while back. We have one regular customer, whom you’ve already met and the clientele here can be... challenging?</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please start talking.</p>
<p class="character">AVA:</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... When I was young my mother always dreamed of me being a nightclub singer. But all I ever dreamed of was going to college. So she disowned me, and off I went to college. And then I went back to college again and again and again, I had a real knack for it. I got this big stack of doctorates. And like most people with a stack of doctorates I spent a lot of time in front of a great big chalkboard. I had a great one, it slid back and forth, I miss that thing. I would write big long equations, publish, write more big long equations, publish again, etcetera...</p>
<p class="dialogue">When you’re a scientist and you spend your time zooming out on the universe you discover that the universe is, inherently, a HUGE bummer. Because everything is dying. Constantly matter and anti-matter is breaking down, forming into something else and breaking down again. Look out the window, we’re going backwards in time at an alarming rate, do you see anything staying put? Even the rocks are changing shape over time.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Myself and my colleauges all accepted that. We accepted that the universe was in a constant state of decay. We had become cororners, really, studying celestial death.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I had a problem. Because on MY chalkboard and my chalkboard alone, all those equations I was writing were slowly pointing toward something. There was a point, somewhere deep in existence, that wasn’t dying. It was a constant. And the universe doesn’t do constants. The universe does death. So this one strange spot in endless space and time, was an anomaly. I tried to tell people about my theory but everybody said I was crazy, which, as a scientist, is when you know you’re awesome.</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what’s a girl to do? Be called crazy her whole life? No. I decided, that I would leave my lovely chalkboard behind and go out and find this thing. I would go to the singular point in all of existence that somehow wasn’t dying.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Turns out it’s a diner. Thanks for the cigarette.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. There’s no fixed spot. Every night at 6pm when I unlock those doors, we’re somewhere else. Sometimes a different time, sometimes a different timline, sometimes a different universe, a different dimension, and sometimes an hour and half outside of Phoenix.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR:</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, today, it was because of you. That’s the theoretical part, the part that Ava doesn’t want to talk about. What I’m convinced of, is that no matter where this place sets down from day to day, when I open the doors to start the day’s business, someone is going to need us. Because how could they not? Like Ava said, it’s all death out there, all the time. Everything’s breaking down. And sometimes people need a place, even if it’s for an hour, or just a few minutes, they need a place to feel like they’re not dying. Because it’s all just too terrifying.</p>
