<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So tell me honestly... what do you think of my cooking?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh, Leif, I don’t know. I mean, how honest do we want to get here?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, come on!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m kidding, I think you’re a great cook.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">For an engineer.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamn it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t understand, you’re an engineer, why have you been wandering around the universe working as a cook?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the curse of being an Earthling.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I mentioned this before, to most spacefaring civilizations Earth is kind of uh....</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The other side of the tracks?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. A lot of star cruisers rolling up their windows as they drive past us, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s hilarious.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you own a spaceship you’re not going to trust your Helical Accelerator to the guy whose entire planet is still fueled by setting shit on fire.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But they trust you to cook?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the hilarious part. No matter where I go, people love Earth food.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They do? Why?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’s so wildly irresponsible. Think about it, Earth food, it’s really bad for you. How much of what’s on your food even needs to be there?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that’s how you make it taste good.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which makes sense to you and me, but for most alien races it’s this bizarre, foreign concept.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Some aliens will take vacations on Earth just for the food.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even though they think it’s a shit hole?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Didn’t you have friends who would go on vacation in third world countries and then they would come back and talk about what a mess the whole country was and “oh my God it’s so dirty” and then they would say-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“But the food was amazing!”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly. That’s us. That’s Earth.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re the third world country?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">One-hundred percent. Haven’t you ever wondered why there’s so many weirdos eating at roadside diners?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re aliens?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nine times out of ten.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I was feeding aliens way before I came here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No doubt about it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">HA!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, guys. What’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif was just telling me that Earth is basically East St. Louis.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true, Earth is the bar in Roadhouse before Patrick Swayze shows up.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, look at us hoodrats.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where’s Ava?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Out in the parking lot again.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s been like this for three days now, maybe we should do something?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you think that would go?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We found a dead Russian scientist in the deep freeze, Leif. It kind of spooked her. Just let her be spooked.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">On the bright side, Effie and Zebulon have been back to normal for the past few days.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, it’s been nice. We should get one of those signs that says “This many days since an accident”.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, except ours would say “This many day since your sentient radio quoted the Egyptian Book of the Dead, switched personalities, or steered you into a supermassive black hole.”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That’s way too long for a sign, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, Leif, that’s way too long.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was kidding.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">My friends, we are growing close to our destination, I trust we are prepared.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Prepared as we can be, Zeb.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Effie, any visions of our destination?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah... yes, well, actually my wife has fallen quite ill and could not join me at this time.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, she has quite the fever at the moment. She has yet to be freed from it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds serious.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does she need to see a doctor?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid the nearest doctor is many miles away. It may be unwise in her infirmed state to take her on such a long journey.</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s sleeping now, hopefully when she awakes her fever will have broken.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I was a kid my mom used to give me really spicy soup to sweat it out of me, do you have anything like that?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid we don’t indulge in such immoderations.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, the whites.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let us know when she wakes up, Zeb.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I will indeed, until then we will have to make do with one Mucklewain, though it does feel strange to be sat in front of the microphone without her.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure she’ll be okay.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah, almost time.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m at my booth.</p>

<p class="dialogue">How are you?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. You?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie’s sick, she has a fever.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s never happened before.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing a little prayer won’t fix, I’m sure.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. So it’s going to be like this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like what?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing. Do you want some coffee?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it’s a “skip straight to moonshine” day for me, thanks. You know where to find me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you know where to find the moonshine.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay... this looks... super normal. This looks like Wyoming or something. I’ve never been to Wyoming. This is how I imagine Wyoming.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I imagine Wyoming like this too, although wait, look. See the horizon?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a glacier wall. Looks like we’re in the ice-age-ish.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m am getting a strange sense that we have been to this place before.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been to the ice-age before.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but this exact place.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s hard to explain. I believe Leif refers to it as “vibes”.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon, you can’t say “vibes”, it doesn’t sound right.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well, Gloria. Shall I say “perturbations”?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what it means, so it’s way better.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What’s with this little radio? How are you getting a reception?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I made it. It’s my little secret. Whenever we’re on an Earth that has radio stations I have this little pocket radio that captures music and stores it. I listen to it when I’m up here.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does the talking radio downstairs know about this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They do not. I love Effie and Zebulon to death but sometimes you just want to hear some music that was made after the great depression, know what I mean?</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, how’d it work out?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Amazing. I was literally able to track food calories as they travelled through their bodies.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sweet, what does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, your average office worker back home burns about 2500 calories a day, right? Guess how many calories your average hunter-gatherer burns?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um, a crazy amount, ten-thousand.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope. Also 2500 calories.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A hunter-gatherer human burns the exact same amount of calories in a day as an average modern human who works in an office and drives a Prius.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that possible?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that possible, Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You tell me.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No way to know for sure without a lab. It basically means that the human body, whether it sits at a desk or forages in a field, burns 2500 calories no matter what we do. Which means that modern man, not having to burn calories on chasing down wild game, burns it some other way.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like what?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">My guess? Inflammation, anxiety, auto-immune responses, all of these things are the human body basically putting the pedal to the metal when the car is in park. I guess it spends it there.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I’d rather spend calories on anxiety than on running away from a saber-toothed tiger.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, do you know how rare those are? I’ve been here six years and I never saw one. I saw bison, I saw small critters-</p>

<p class="dialogue">Why? There’s not a meteor coming is there?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, my sexy friend, the only meteor headed their way is our distant relatives... We’re on the brink of it right now. The end of the Younger Dryas.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pretty soon humans will figure out that the glaciers are retreating for the last time and it will be open season on anything that moves. The great Holocene extinction will begin. They’ll wipe out their food source, then realize they screwed themselves, then grow bigger brains to figure out how to un-screw themselves, then they’ll start keeping animals, and farming. Once they figure that out their brains will shrink again and before you know it... they’ll be us.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Studies the biological processes of evolution. Natural selection, speciation, all that garbage. She’s brilliant in her field, apparently. I’d always see her getting grants and awards.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But wait, if she hitched a ride on Midnight Burger to get back to the ice age, there was no way for her to get back again.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He did.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, consider this a visitation from the past. For six years I have been camping out at the very beginnings of our species. I have glimpsed the origins of us. I am here to tell you, with authority... we fucked it all up.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We did?</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this an actual conversation we’re having or is this one of those conversations where you say things just to get everyone to look at you?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fair point, fair point. I definitely do that. And I must say it is intoxicating to talk to people that actually understand the words coming out of my mouth after six years in a land of no complex language. BUT. I am serious. This is serious. You have to quit.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I don’t want to quit.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes you do. I can see it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jane, what the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry. Let me start from the beginning. Six years ago, Midnight Burger dropped me off at the end of the last great Ice Age. Leif had really set me up, I had all kinds of wonderful whizz-bangs and whirly-gigs. I was going to be able to observe early homo-sapiens from afar without them ever knowing I was there. So I did. I found a nice little nomadic tribe of humans making their way across what would one day be central Europe, I think. And as I watched them, over the course of a year, I began to think about Thomas Hobbes. Anyone? Thomas Hobbes?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who is that?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am familiar with the work of Mr. Hobbes.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="dialogue">I do.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, one plate of food that is not a Mastodon or whatever.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That looks amazing.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’d I miss?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jane is apparently here to convince Ava to quit being a scientist.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? Why?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re still trying to figure that out.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s not going to quit being a scientist.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She really should though.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No she shouldn’t. She great at it, you don’t quit something you’re great at.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know she’s great at it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Chapter eight.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, once upon a time Thomas Hobbes tried to describe the nightmare that life would be if we had no society. Start with the passage “In such condition...”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">In such condition, in such, in such, Ah. Here. “In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man-”</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“-solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Ava, I watched these people for six years, and all of those things that Hobbes describes... I saw none of it. These people are happy. They have community, they love each other, they protect each other-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They check each other for tics.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They do. They do that, and you know what? It’s sweet.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s tics, Jane.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jane, I don’t think your argument is landing, what are you getting at here? What does this have to do with Ava?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was all a waste. My life’s work, Ava’s life work, our collective life’s work of making the society we live in, it was all a waste. The humans I’ve been studying, they’re happier than us. In some ways healthier than us. They don’t shut themselves off from each other, they draw each other close.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I don’t want to draw people close.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, why do we do this? These scientific endeavors, why do we put ourselves through years of school, navigate the bullshit halls of academia? We convince ourselves that it all moves everything forward towards some sort of glorious end, right? It doesn’t. Over thousands of years all we’ve managed to do is make ourselves more miserable, more alone, sicker. Our only achievement through the centuries appears to be the towering mountain of things we have convinced ourselves of.... I know you feel it too. I can see it in your eyes. Did something happen? Something shake your tree a little bit?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Let’s have another drink.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">This is some bullshit.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="dialogue">Definitely knives out. Zebulon, knives out.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, then. Come at me, bro.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jane, here’s the thing. You’re saying that mankind was at it’s purest and happiest when we were hunter-gatherers, right?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that Ava should quit her scientific endeavors because moving society ever forward has just made us more miserable?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also true.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why change? Things moved forward, we started living in houses, we evolved into a world where somehow corn is in all of our food, we invented baseball. If everything was so perfect, why did we evolve past that?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because evolution is bad.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s literally your life’s work.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, talking radio, what’s the greatest trick the devil ever pulled?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Convincing us he doesn’t exist.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the greatest trick evolution ever pulled was convincing us that it was good. Well, I shouldn’t say good. Evolution isn’t good or bad, it’s just a force that is completely and totally unconcerned with your happiness. Evolution and progress aren’t the same thing. The goal of evolution isn’t happiness.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Evolution has only one goal: more babies. It will make you do anything it can for you to have more babies. Animal husbandry, complex farming, hierarchical societies, land ownership, colonialism, all of these things led to a cascade of unhappiness and a whole heck of a lot of babies.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And a whole heck of a lot of other things too, right, c’mon.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow, I did not expect an argument for colonialism.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, shut up, I’m not arguing for colonialism, I’m arguing for air conditioning, and hospitals, and antibiotics, and gelato.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the question that philosophers have been asking since the modern age. Does all of this progress, all of these modern advancements, do they make us intrinsically happier? You can’t truly know unless you were there before the advancements. I was there for six years. The answer is no.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I agree with her.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zeb, knives out!</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But her point is well heard. It is not modern advancements that should give us joy but rather the glory of our Lord, and doing good works in his name.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look at that, I’ve got Jesus on my side!</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I’ve always thought that your most important words should go last. The last words of the Bible: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Surely the most important part. And the last word in Mr. Habbes writing: short. Their lives were short.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Life span!</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here we go.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">As a straight white male you know one thing about me: I’ve watched a lot of History Channel. And I know for a fact that the farther back you go, the shorter the life span. Surely a longer life is a good enough reason to evolve.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. A long life is a good thing.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it though?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jane.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay fine, I’ll grant you that. The modern world we’re all from does seem to afford you a longer life. Congratulations.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, point for us.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But let me ask you this: How much of that time is yours? This long life of yours, how much of it belongs to you? Odds are your average modern human will spend the majority of their waking hours in an office somewhere or a restaurant working to mostly benefit someone they’ll never meet. They’ll have a few hours with their loved ones at night and then get a few hours of sleep and then do it all over again the next day. Congratulations on a long life. It doesn’t belong to you, it belongs to your boss.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that any different from hunting and gathering all day?</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They work twenty hours a week, Caspar. For them, when you’re good at your job, it’s over sooner. We think that an affluent society is one where you have everything you want, but the real-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">-but the real affluent society is the one that wants less things. Jane this is the same diatribe that you would bombard frat guys with at parties, all we need are red cups full of Natural Lite.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the only flaw in my argument back then was lack of evidence. We can’t truly know what life was like for early mankind because we weren’t there. I was there.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then go back to the Planck Institute and make your case.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>

<p class="dialogue">It was easy. Leif had given me all these great tools before I left. I had a laser torch to make fire, I had this cloaking device on my belt so I could disappear right in front of their eyes. What more do you need? I would appear suddenly, set something on fire, and the disappear! They were terrified! It was hilarious. So their God concept developed real quick, and suddenly I was running the show. They’ll do whatever I ask them to... With Leif’s help I’m going to remake the world the way it should’ve been. A simpler one. A happier one.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh relax, Padre, you’re not the innocent one here. You know it’s no coincidence that hierarchical religions arose at the same time as hierarchical societies. “Work hard and you’ll be rewarded in the afterlife!” Any of that sound familiar?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re actually done with the theoretical debate portion of the day, Jane, so eyes on me please. Bring Leif back right now.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No... No, I can’t do that, Caspar. I need him. About a year ago I had everything set up. I was their God, they were building a shrine, it was going well. But I needed to kick it up a notch. I’m really building something here and I need someone with a particular skill set. “What am I to do?” I asked myself. And then suddenly... there was a diner. I could’ve done this much more seamlessly but when you showed up I knew I only had 12 hours, so I had to improvise.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought I would come in here and distract you as long as I could while my minions carried Leif back to their village. I thought I’d go for the Hail Mary pass and try and convince Ava to come with me, but who am I kidding? She’s still got work to do... You know they’re never going to let you back in, Ava. You can come back with all the evidence in the world and you’re still going to be the crazy lady they pushed into emeritus status.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m thinking a chair, some rope, and I’ll pour hot coffee on her, let’s do some Guantanamo shit.</p>
<p class="character">JANE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s no use, guys. The only thing you can threaten me with is to take me with you. But if you did you’d be leaving Leif all alone on an ancient Earth. And he’s such a creature of the modern age, isn’t he? And then who do you think my followers will blame when their God abandons them? It’s no use, guys. Leif’s mine. You may as well let me go so that at least he’s not by himself... Besides, who among you can stand against a God?</p>

<p class="dialogue">We will need to be ready. But Jane... of all the troubles in my various fevered visions... ain’t none of them you. You are a waste of our time and our time’s gotten scarce, so will you kindly return Leif to us or will I need to treat you like yesterday’s periodicals and line my chicken coop with you?</p>
