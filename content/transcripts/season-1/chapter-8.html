<p class="dialogue">So now we can hear you guys AND the song.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And we can also hear it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you’re not playing this song?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are not.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So this song is coming from somewhere else?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we don’t know from where.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We do not.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’re saying that when “Me from the future” was here the other day he said what to you?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“It’s all part of the plan.”</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then he attached some sort of device to the radio.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then removed it, we believe.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then this song started playing and you guys started quoting from the Egyptian Book of the Dead for no reason.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is the next thing that happened, yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then you guys proceeded to say NOTHING AT ALL to us about this.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">For a whole day.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">One day went by.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Twenty-four hours.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not that time exists.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like if you guys were kindergarteners there would be a note to your parents saying “does not play well with the other children”.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re very sorry, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He said “It’s all part of the plan”, What’s the plan?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are unaware of any plan.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t understand, a plan for what?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like this at all, guys. I don’t like secret plans, I don’t like weird behavior.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where’s Gloria?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I know what he did.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think he fine tuned the signal.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about this seems fine tuned to you?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine tuned isn’t the right word.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think there’s a right word for this.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re getting more information. It’s like we have a satellite dish on the roof now.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The door to the deep freeze is open and I can’t find Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria?</p>

<p class="dialogue">She’s not in the kitchen, she’s not anywhere. Caspar. The door. To the deep freeze. Is open.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Didn’t we?</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do we?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, think back. When you first got here did we warn you about the deep freeze?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did we?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... Okay, honestly until right this minute I kinda forgot we had a deep freeze.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Goddamn it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, you could have. But sometimes, people talking, maybe I hear it, I tune a lot out because I get bored.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Come on.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT'D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh god, what is this now?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Most stories start with something like “It was THIS date and THIS time in THIS place.” But what do you do when you’re talking about a place that has no place? Or a place that has no time? We’re speaking of course, of the diner at the end and somehow the beginning of the universe... Midnight Burger.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve heard the stories. Across space and time, no matter how distant or how close, someone will be in a jam, they won’t know where to go, and then suddenly... There is a diner.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No one knows where Midnight Burger came from, no one knows who, if anyone, built it and no one knows why it exists. But what if I told you that inside the greatest mystery in the multi-verse there was yet another mystery?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tucked away in a corner, inside the diner at the nexus of all things, is an old, dilapidated freezer. And inside that freezer? A world that may hold the secrets to the diner itself.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is this? They’re doing a documentary now?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. It’s worse.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Join us this season as we go... Into the Deep Freeze.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a deep dive podcast.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">C’mon, we don’t have time for this.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No one has time for them.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve got to get in there before Gloria gets turned into dog chow.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why doesn’t she just come back?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s possible she doesn’t know the way out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We lost a customer in there once.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a busy day, they thought it was the bathroom, they never came out. Everybody put your coats on.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, Ava, maybe you should stay, I don’t know what’s going to happen in there.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stay here and serve food to people? I’ll take the wolves, thanks.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You had to wonder what they were thinking at this point. I get nervous when I defrost my freezer, they were about to leap into one.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And theirs had wolves in it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">At least you knew that they were always using fresh produce.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">When frozen peas means you may lose an arm, it does keep the menu in season.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Parts of me are getting cold that have never gotten cold before.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">When Ava, Leif, and Caspar first went through the freezer door they were hit with a massive windstorm.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, it was almost like the deep freeze didn’t want them to be there.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are we still hearing them?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">For Christ’s sake, they’re coming through the walkie talkies.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?!</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, already they’re thinking that this was a terrible mistake. One second they’re in the diner, the next second they’re surrounded by ice and mountains and forests.  They’re snow blind and they have no idea where Gloria is.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And this is where they find the campsite.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, look. A campsite.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s camping here?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. It’s new though, someone’s been using it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s got to be her. Gloria!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s been here five minutes, she didn’t have time to camp.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well who else could it be? Mr. Tumnus? Look, we can’t spend a lot of time here. We’ve got to find Gloria and then find a way out of here.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You do know for sure that there is a way out of here right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If there’s a way into something there’s a way out of something, right?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, isn’t that a law of something?</p>

<p class="dialogue">How did they find us so fast?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re surrounded. Did anyone bring any treats?</p>

<p class="dialogue">We’re the treats, dude.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What kind of Nanook of the North bullshit is this now?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I knew you’d find me eventually. I kept telling my dawgs here, but I don’t think they believed me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you wearing animal skins?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean eventually? We just noticed you were gone.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really? Well, I’ve been here for I don’t know how long. The moon’s been full twice now, how long is that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two months?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like there’s some weird time shit going on, I don’t know. Ava can probably figure it out. Hey, Leif, help me get this deer carcass into the camp.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be right back.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, that’s crazy. Gloria had been there for two months.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s wild, I mean, it shouldn’t be wild because we’re talking about Midnight Burger, but still, it’s wild.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It really makes my head spin to think about it, but luckily you were able to talk to someone who can explain this time discrepancy to us.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, so as everyone knows Midnight Burger has its own resident theoretical physicist, Dr. Ava. Luckily I was able to sit down with her to talk about this issue of time.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, thanks for being with us today.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">To your average person this is impossible to understand. How can five minutes in one place equal two months in another place?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... well it’s... called gravitational time dilation.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you say that like it’s no big deal. To me it’s like, whoa, what is that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s part of relativity theory.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is Einstein’s relativity theory?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, that one. This is so annoying, Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Talk to the guy who doesn’t know anything about physics. Explain it to that guy.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine, the closer you get to the center of a gravitational well, the slower time goes. So, the core of the earth, for example, is actually two and a half years younger than the surface of the earth because of the additional distance to the center.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s crazy.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So crazy.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">So somehow the gravity is different inside the deep freeze?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Could be. But it also applies to inertia. Time slows down the closer you are to a gravity well or the closer you are to the speed of light.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that why, when I’m moving fast around my house, getting a lot of things done, that I feel like time slows down?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, that’s just you feeling like a superhero for doing basic housework.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Carrying something heavy.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Holy shit, you guys, check out this deer.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, how did you kill a deer?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wasn’t me it was my wolf pals here. They’d take down a whole deer and then look at me like “Hey mom, can we have this?”</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, I’ve got to apologize, I thought we had warned you about the deep freeze.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry about it, Caspar, it’s not like there’s a new employee orientation or something. Honestly, I was freaked out at first but, I don’t know, it’s kind of nice in here. I’m from Arizona, I don’t get to play in the snow.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I spent a couple of weeks looking around for a way out of here but then I remembered Smokey the Bear. “Remember kids, if you’re lost in the woods, hug a tree and wait for someone to find you.” So I hugged a tree.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The problem with that is we don’t know the way out either.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, but we’ll figure something out. I mean, we’ve been through some shit, y’all. We always figure it out. OH! I forgot. Leif, check out what I found when I was looking for the exit. Hang on.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... Hello, yes. I believe I am recording now... I will make these recordings in English as this is my intended Audience. I am making this recording in Cordoba, Spain while attending the second International Conference of Nuclear Free Zones. It is very exciting to have this tape recorder. It is the only thing I have ever bought with the currency of the west.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Last night, my government handler became very inebriated and passed out in his room. I then attended a card game in the room of one of the scientists from American delegation. We played an American game called “Texas Hold Them”. I had never played a game of American cards before. I have discovered that I am very good at cards. Since it is all numbers and probability I, as a physicist, did quite well. I left the hotel room last night with a handfull of Spanish currency and my government knew nothing about it.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I debate with myself all night. What to do with this currency? Do I report? Do I keep it secret? Then this morning as my handler was still unconscious in his room, I did the most dangerous thing I have ever done. I went shopping.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have purchased this Ferguson tape recorder. On it I will state my intentions and document my journey.</p>
<p class="dialogue">My name is Vladimir Valentinovich Alexandrov. It is my intention to defect to the United States of America and share with them what I have found.</p>

I am now outside the reach of imminent death. Somehow. And when one is outside the reach of death one must then look up and begin to ask questions of the world that has not killed you.</p>

<p class="character">VLADIMIR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This place, it is much like my home country but the constellations in the sky are not right. These are not the constellations of Earth. I am not home. Such bitter poetry, an amazing discovery and with no one to tell. No one to tell and no one to come save me, so I must take action. Here is my plan. When I look to the west as the sun sets I believe I can see something reflecting its light. It is miles away, it may take many days to get there, but it seems like the next logical step. Tomorrow my new wolf friends and I will head west. Perhaps I will find answers there. Oh, yes, there’s is one more thing. The tapes I am making, in an attempt to increase the chances of my story being discovered, I will deposit these tapes along the trail in the most conspicuous place I can find. Making a trail of breadcrumbs as I go into the forest, so to speak. Until next time...</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey. Yeah. Great to be here?</p>

<p class="dialogue">You and Caspar were saying that this place in the deep freeze was a pocket dimension. Tell us about that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’m not much of a theoretical guy, but the concept is that any given universe starts off small and slowly expands. If that’s the case there will still be universes where it seems like all of existence is only, say, a few feet wide. That’s the theory anyway.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well you say it’s a theory but the first time you met Gloria you were hiding in a pocket dimension, isn’t that right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I called it that but honestly that could’ve been anything. I’m one of those “anything can be anything” guys but I don’t talk about that a lot because if the words “Principle of Fecundity” come out of my mouth then Ava throws things at me.</p>

<p class="dialogue">ANYWAYS. I don’t think this is a pocket dimension I think this is our original universe.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What makes you say that?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There would be different laws of physics in other universes. Everything seems like home here. Things go up, they come down. A Russian dude’s voice is stored on a tape using the powers of electromagnetism. This is our universe, we’re just somewhere else in it. Ask Ava, she’ll say the same.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I think he’s right.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Leif, you’re an engineer. You make things that go whoosh, things that go boom, things like that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what is the deep freeze, then? How did it get you here?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, that’s the easy part. The tech to move a body from one place to the other is pretty common. Even on Earth, backwater as it is, there are theoretical designs, they just have one really glaring problem. A power source. The amount of energy you would need to manipulate space isn’t going to come from internal combustion, you need more juice than that.</p>

The mysterious songs, the random quotations, the sudden silence, not to mention the time you flew us into a supermassive black hole without any explanation. And now here we are, stuck in the deep freeze without any way out and you two have decided to suddenly become WNYC’s Radiolab. And I’ve put up with that too. But I think all three of us are aware that the line of questioning you were on just now is crossing a line. So how about you guys go back to playing your fun theme music before I start screaming at the top of my lungs and bury us in fifteen feet of snow?</p>

<p class="dialogue">What happened?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I lost everything. God literally laughed at my plans. I’ve seen some really weird shit since I’ve been here, but I have yet to wrap my mind around the fact that one day I was running a restaurant and then suddenly the next day no one could even talk to each other. It all just vanished. As horrible as that was, something good came along with it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can relate to that. Cruise around the starways enough and you find yourself in a constant conversation with the universe. Bad shit happens, you live through it, and then you say “Oh, that wasn’t the end of the world? Okay. What is, then?”</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. They’re so weird. You know, in the rare moments that they’re nice to each other they literally look over their shoulders to make sure no one is watching them be nice. It’s ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">VLADIMIR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have developed a new respect for the old masters; Galileo and Pythagoras. They had no institutes or computational devices. Only their perception and candlelight. In tribute to them, today I have used my ingenuity. Using the sunbeams through the tree branches and the straight lines they provide, I believe I have calculated the curvature of this strange new planet.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Cool.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but can he climb a tree?</p>
<p class="character">VLADIMIR</p>
<p class="dialogue">If my calculations are correct, this planet is massive. Three times the size of Jupiter, I believe.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa.</p>
<p class="character">VLADIMIR</p>
<p class="dialogue">In fact, I hypothesize that this planet does not revolve around it’s nearby star but rather they rotate around each other much like a binary star system, and the moons I see in the sky are in fact the other planets in this system, all of them revolving around us. Such incredible gravitational forces. If we could harness such power, think of the freedoms it would give us. We could end all human scarcity. We could transform ourselves.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Cool guy.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what was his deal?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">His deal?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, like what was he famous for?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, he was famous for disappearing, but before that: nuclear winter.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">He used physics to predict the outcome of a thermonuclear war. During the Cold War both sides were trying to convince themselves that they could win. He was the guy who said that, even if you win, you lose. Honestly, the world he predicted isn’t much different from this planet.</p>
<p class="dialogue">A gray sky, everything covered in snow. Except in his version the snow, and everything else, is radioactive.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry you never got to meet him.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">He could still be alive.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? No, he couldn’t. The way time works on this planet it could’ve been hundreds of years since he first came here.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">But remember what I said about time and gravity? If this really is a planet and a star in binary rotation we don’t know how gravity may shift. Time could actually speed up and slow down.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds like a reach to me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Whispering)</p>

Regardless, I wish to speak to you now, my mysterious friend. Know this, if you are hearing this message then together we are victorious. For my story has been told. I will live on at least in your memory. Tomorrow I will journey to my first camp and deposit the tape recorder there for you to find. Do svidaniya.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Urt Door? Anybody?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it, Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why didn’t he use it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
