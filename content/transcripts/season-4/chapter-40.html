<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A BUSY COFFEE SHOP.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here’s your cappuccino.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks. I could’ve come up there.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, it’s no problem. Do you want to hear something funny?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We get secret shoppers coming in here from corporate sometimes. They will literally order a cappuccino, then go out to a van where they have equipment that can weigh the amount of foam we’ve put on the cappuccinos.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re kidding.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s so ridiculous. I love your phone screen.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s mine. It’s a piece a did.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re a street artist?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s so cool. I love it.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow, what phone is that? Is that the new one?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you believe this, look at my phone, my screen is so fucked.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">A cracked screen is a sign of a busy life.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me about it, I just got it last year and already this happened.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Last year?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Ridiculous. Are you new to the area, I haven’t seen you in here before, we have a lot of regulars.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I... just got here.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, have you heard of Nicki Minaj?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have I heard of her?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">My friends are going to her show tonight and we have an extra ticket. Might be a good way to get to know people if you’re new in town.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, sure, why not?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cool. Give me your phone, I’ll put in my number.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Typing.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow, this phone is so cool, okay, there you go. Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Got it.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m working until six and then my friends are picking me up here.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds like fun.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great! Anyway, like I said, I’m Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, Dustin. Dustin Watson</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice to meet you, Dustin Watson.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Same here.</p>
<p class="direction">FIONA WALKS AWAY.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In David’d earpiece.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys, round of applause for David’s first on-the-fly Alias, let’s hear it.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY APPLAUD.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very funny.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good job, David. She really bought it.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She did. Such a tragedy, though.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, if this were a normal situation, she would stalk me on Instagram, being very careful not to like anything, and then she would finally see my pictures from LA Pride 2018 and her little heart would be crushed.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks for describing my late twenties to me, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">But this is, of course, not a normal situation.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me. How far are we from Earth right now?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">About 820,000 light years as the crow flies, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh-huh. Y’all I’m at a Starbucks.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s pretty weird, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You haven’t seen something like this before?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been to a bunch of different versions of Earth but they’re always where Earth is supposed to be. This place looks like Earth but like Leif said, it’s in the wrong place. We’re trying to figure it out.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, remember we were talking about Cryptessia?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s where the Sisters went.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. That’s where the diner took us. We didn’t travel through dimensions, we did’t travel through time, we just traveled spatially. And somehow here in Cryptessia is a duplicate of Earth.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I say I’m disappointed? I was expecting octopus creatures on Glorbnar-7 or something.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We didn’t know what to expect but we didn’t expect this.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, if it is another Earth, it’s from a few years ago.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her phone was an older phone but she said she got it last year. That was like an iPhone 5, it still had a button on it. Also, she asked me if I had heard of Nicki Minaj, like her first album had just dropped.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting. Good catch, David.</p>
<p class="direction">THERE’S AN ALERT ON DAVID’S PHONE.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">One moment... Oh my.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">The audacity.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">A man in this Starbucks has just airdropped a shirtless picture to me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure how I should respond to that in this situation.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, how does he look?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No hookups on the hostile alien planet, please.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, c’mon. That’s where the best hookups are.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, you’re doing a great job but I don’t think we need you to go that undercover.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it’s important to acknowledge that I have had two people hit on me already at this Starbucks, so I may be far from home, but I’m thriving.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Acknowledged.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, can we get him back here please, we’re really pushing it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, David, you can come on back.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Hang on.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I saw something, Hang on.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are you going?</p>
<p class="direction">DAVID WALKS OUT OF THE STARBUCKS AND ONTO THE BUSY STREET.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m walking down the street.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Walking down the street towards us, I hope.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">This place is trying to convince us that it’s Earth, right?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know if it’s trying to convince us of anything but, they’ve got Nicki Minaj. That’s a pretty deep detail.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">If it’s trying to be Earth then why am I following a woman down the street with green skin right now?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Green skin?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. David, look around, is there anyone else who has alien vibes?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s Earthlings wall to wall.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is anyone else seeing her?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s like she perfectly blends in.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird. Okay, stay on her, David.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, we talked about this, these guys may know who we are so we sent David to look around, it’s the best choice.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the best choice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, can you give me anything other than green?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t see her that well.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t make contact, hang back.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang way back, please.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we get him some camomile tea?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, Caspar can you chill out, please?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s easy for you to say, my son just volunteered for a life of danger.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">This fool thought he could show me a time-traveling dimension-spanning diner and I would just go back to work on Monday.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The quiet life is underrated, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Depends on your rating system... Hang on, she stopped.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s she doing?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s looking around... She looks...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like what?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know that look people have right before they do something crazy?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know that look.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She just went into a convenience store, should I follow her?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wouldn’t, David, you might lose her in there.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. I think I saw yellow stripes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Green with yellow stripes, green with yellow stripes. Lemonier?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re just as far from there as we are from Earth.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s already out... She’s got a gallon of water in her hands.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is anyone noticing her yet?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kind of. But they’re just walking past her like she’s some weird lady on the street.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh-oh. Cops.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cop car is rolling by slowly... Oh lord, she has picked up a trash can.</p>

<p class="dialogue">This is a lie! They are lying to you! You are being lied to!</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure what she was trying to accomplish but... respect.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You do?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s green?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’ve got her in the car.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was one of the refugees?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, she was just a kid.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need to talk to her.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s going to be a little hard now.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, David, get back here, we need to figure this out.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If she’s here, the others could be here.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>

<p class="dialogue">David, what the fuck!</p>
<p class="direction">LATER. INSIDE THE COP CAR. WE HEAR THE DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE. WE ARE NOW INSIDE THE COP CAR WITH DAVID AND MALOO.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello there.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">How can you see me? Who are you?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like everybody can see you, I’m the only one who sees a green person.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. I’m David. You know my dad, Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar. He’s here?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s here, the diner’s here.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Libuza was right. She said he would come back. Are the sisters here?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re not here?</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were separated.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maloo, what’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know where to start.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you been arrested before?</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Is that what they’re doing?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. We’re going to the precinct and they’re going to process us, after they process us, they’re going to split us up. That’s how much time you have to tell me everything.</p>
<p class="direction">THE TWO COPS GET INTO THE CAR AND START THE ENGINE.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clock’s ticking.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll start at the beginning...</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE ROOF OF THE DINER. DAVID DEBRIEFS THE TEAM.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In their earpieces.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">So when their colony got attacked, the refugees all got split up, they don’t know where. Maloo says there’s a small group of them being held in a building somewhere. She said it was a building with a picture of a disturbing man on it, that’s all she can give me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A disturbing man on it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did she get out?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">The mystery men said to them that if they agreed to try and live peacefully in their society, they could go free. Maloo agreed because she thought if she got out of confinement she could try and find a way out, or a way to contact someone.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, Lemonians are green amphibians, how come nobody is noticing that about her?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She doesn’t know.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, obviously the diner brought us here for the refugees, right? Fuck, even if it didn’t we’re getting the refugees out.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">“A building with a disturbing man on the front” isn’t much to go with.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We go with what we’ve got. I don’t know what’s going on with this weird Pleasantville planet we’re on, but let’s focus on the real stuff. We’ve got two problems: we need to get David and this girl out of jail and we need to find this secret prison they’re keeping the refugees in.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re doing double jailbreaks now?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, we’ve got some weird army on our trail, so let’s not attract too much attention.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can bail them out of jail.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I can bail them out of jail.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, have you ever bailed someone out of jail? I’ve bailed so many sous chefs out of jail that I’m basically a lawyer. I’ll handle jail, I need you to hit the streets and see if you can find a building with a disturbing man on it. Leif, lock up the front door and see if you can find out anything more about this planet.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to try and find out if they’ve got satellites. If they have iPhones there’s got to be GPS. I’ll try and get a bird’s eye view.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. David, have you seen anyone using money?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In earpiece.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, just looks like regular cash.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, is this going on my permanent record?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You bet your ass it’s going on your permanent record.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Be a dad later, Caspar. Go find the refugees. David, I’m coming to you.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bring Top Ramen. It’s like currency in here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No prison jokes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everybody get to work, please?</p>
<p class="direction">IN THE POLICE PRECINCT. DAVID AND MALOO ARE HANDCUFFED TO A BENCH.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, assuming this works like Earth, we’ll be handcuffed to this bench for a few hours while everyone ignores us, then they’ll take us off to holding cells and wait for someone to bail us out.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve done this before?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had a bit of a misspent youth, yes... You know, you’re my first alien.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never met someone from another planet before.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. You don’t disappoint.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, look at you. You’re green, you’ve got webbed feet. Pretty cool. Caspar tells me you’re amphibious.</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you can breathe underwater?</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Only when we’re babies. Then we learn to breathe air.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, your whole childhood is underwater?</p>
<p class="character">MALOO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And we are yellow when we are born and then we turn green.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is fucking amazing, Maloo.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are some adults that I don’t speak to like adults, one of them is your dad.... Every universe has a lot of crazy and wonderful and terrifying things in them. But every universe, despite all the things in it—it’s still mostly nothing. The chances of this girl ending up somewhere where she was safe... it’s almost zero... most likely she was teleported into the void of space somewhere.</p>

<p class="dialogue">The suburbs, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was this thing that happened in LA. Turned out all the surrounding cities were sweeping up the unhoused people and just dumping them in Skid Row downtown, like it was a landfill. Keeping the suburbs clean. They’ve got to be keeping them somewhere.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... Is it always like this?</p>

<p class="dialogue">No... no, this is different. Your dad wasn’t exaggerating. He was right to freak out that you stowed away with us.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m surprised he let me leave the diner.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me too. But I think he was trying to respect your choices... Regardless, you’re in it now. Anything else you want to tell me before I try and bail you out?</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Why 2012?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That barista, her phone was an iPhone 5 I think. Niki Minaj’s first album came out around then, too. Also, that guy that tried to airdrop me a shirtless photo? Let’s just say that airdrop was an over-utilized function when it first came out and it was also around 2012.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Weird. Good work, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>

<p class="dialogue">All’s quiet. I’m assuming the three we met were the ones in charge of the refugees. Definitely more on the way though. That one that Peter lazered was about where you’re standing. I guess the body got teleported away. Really wanted a look at that tech.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any way you can see them coming?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. That’s a tough one. These guys are lightyears ahead of the Teds. I don’t even know how their tech works yet, I just know what it does. How are things down there?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re getting the refugees situated. I think they’re going to be pretty on edge until we take off, which is when?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just a few minutes.</p>

<p class="dialogue">We’re getting them all, Leif.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Regardless, it’s great to see all your faces again. Brings back a lot of memories... I’m sorry we couldn’t save Maloo. She was just trying to find a way out to get help... The rest of her family isn’t here, I see. But we’re...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re going to find them. We’re going to find all of them.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone, this is Gloria. She runs the place now. I think you all probably remember what a bad job I was doing of running the place, I was glad when she showed up.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, everyone. We’re going to get underway any minute now. We’ve got plenty of room, so spread out, grab a booth—just not that one over there. These next few days are going to be tough, but I imagine you’re used that by now... Everyone here understands what it’s like to not have a place in the world. So, while you’re here, it may not be home, but it’ll be the next best thing until we get you where you need to go. Until then, the good news is that Caspar’s not going to be cooking anymore.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Huell’s gotten us out of a lot of jams, David. I stand by it. There’s something about his personality, you just want to let him in... You know who else has come in handy a couple of times?</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Did you know her?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, not really. I just recognized her voice because she was always yelling at her little brother.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her little brother would always take salt and pepper shakers and ketchup bottles and napkin holders and make a model of the house he was going to live in when they got to their planet...</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She talked about you like you were their savior.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, this place means a lot to a lot of people but I never meant for it to mean anything to anybody. I was just trying to stay alive. I went from processing people’s application for a license plate for their boat... to this. I never feel good enough for it. I never feel like it was supposed to be me.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know you’re mad that I snuck aboard.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, there is a very strong part of me that wants you to wrap yourself in bubble wrap and be a librarian, of course I’m mad... But I’m glad you’re here... I’m glad you chose to be here. I’m glad you’re the kind of person who makes choices. I’m glad that you’re bold about it. I also hate every single bit of it... Okay?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Why did we steal a barista?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... yeah, I don’t think Gloria even knows yet. In situations like this she acts a little impulsively. Like the last time we went to war with an intergalactic empire. I would love to say that hostages are a new thing but, there was this guy Ted one time... I’ll tell you about it later- OW!</p>

<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In Caspar’s head.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Schmoopie. How’re you doing? Did I get captured by the bad guys in the off chance that I’d be able to talk directly into your head like this?... Maybe.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Anyway, we’ve got the diner signal up on the navigation thingee and we’re heading in your direction. Now, listen, I know that these few hours away from me have been very difficult for you, dummy, but don’t worry. Very soon now we can get back to our usual routine of me ignoring you and you bringing me things. Get excited! Okay, going through a wormhole, bye!</p>
