<p class="direction">WE HEAR ETHERIAL MUSIC. WE HEAR ZEBULON IN HIS “BRAM FRAMPTON” PERSONA.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The year was 1950. Deep in the mountains of California, Albert George Wilson looked into the telescope of the Palomar Observatory and realized he’d seen something majestic, something heretofore hidden from prying eyes by the bright light of the star Regulus. It was a galaxy. We would come to know it as Leo, as The Regulus Dwarf. But these days we’ve come to call it... Cryptessia. We’ve come to call it a treacherous place ruled by a mysterious army. We’ve also come to call it the site of the universe’s very first Midnight Burger Speedrun!</p>
<p class="direction">THE MUSIC NOW PICKS UP INTO AN OLYMPICS-LIKE INTRO MUSIC.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">100 refugees, 1000 planets, and an army of oogies on their trail. We’ll watch as our heroes risk life and limb to save as many refugees as they can before the malevolent Benefactor puts the hammer down. Get ready, get set, get out! It’s the Midnight Burger Speedrum, y’all!</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(As Kitty Caldwell.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome back, everyone, I’m Kitty Caldwell here with Bram Frampton and we will be your hosts for the most anticipated event in the multiverse! Bram has set the scene, now let’s meet our players! Bram, who’s the lineup for the Midnight Burger team this time around?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty, the Midnight Burger lineup is stacked to the brim right now. We’ve got Gloria leading the way with her spatula of justice, then there’s Leif, the pirate engineer, followed up by the baddest brains in the starways, Dr. Ava Maddox. Then there are the wild cards, Effie and Zebulon Mucklewain, the non-corporeal spiritual leaders of the group, and a new addition to the team is David, a street artist hailing from Los Angeles who brings some fresh street smarts to the Midnight Burger crew. Also his dad is here. But our team is not alone this time, are they now Kitty?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No they are not, Bram. Joining forces with the diner this time around are The Sisters, a trio of freedom fighters from the Triad. We’ve got Libuza, the techno-seer, Teta the battle-hardened mercenary, and Kazi the leader and brilliant military tactician. Some have called her cold-blooded, but that’s only because she is literally cold blooded, like her blood is actually cold y’all, we don’t know how it works. It’s disturbing. Bram?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here’s the score as it stands, Kitty. Planets to go: 997, refugees left to save: 102</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They have got their work cut out for them.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty we’re going to join our team at a tense moment, as you can see they’re all waiting in the parking lot for the arrival of a new batch of refugees.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And where have they found themselves today, Bram?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty, this particular planet has the codename “9th Century” a planet that is being deliberately kept in a system of feudalism. It’s a whole planet of lords, peasants, and serfs.</p>

<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good morning, Theo.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good morning, Betty. How are you feeling this morning.</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m feeling okay.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just okay?</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not great, honestly. I’m dreading going to work today.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'm sorry to hear that, Betty.</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do so much at that office. I handle payroll, I train the new hires, I water the plants! And it feels like nobody even notices.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">That's a lot of responsibilities you're juggling. It must be frustrating to put in so much effort without recognition.</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly! Just today, friggn’ Sarah got praised in our team meeting for finishing this big report. Never mind that I stayed late three nights last week helping her compile all that data. It’s like they don’t even see me there.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m so sorry about that, Betty. I want you to know that I see you and I appreciate you.</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks, Theo. Sometimes I think I should just stop doing all the extra stuff. Let them see what happens when no one handles the lunch order or teaches the new guy the filing system.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think you should do that, Betty. You might create chaos and a hostile work environment. How about I shower you with praise and soothing thoughts?</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that sound nice.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your choice of pants-suits have been particularly fashion-forward lately.</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have they really?</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And you were right about artificial sweetener. Since you stopped using it, your anxiety levels have dropped sharply.</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I knew it.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know you did, Betty. Would you like me to show you more pictures of that island you’re going to take a vacation to someday?</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oooh. Yes.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(As Kitty.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bram, where in the heck have they found themselves today?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">This here is a wild one, Kitty. We have now moved to a planet codenamed “Weizenbaum.” It’s looking like everyone on the planet has got themself a little bot in their pocket that they can talk to when they’re feeling lonely.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that doesn’t sound too bad.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Little do they know, these little bots are designed to keep everyone from avoiding conflict and to keep everyone’s bullshit cosigned, pardon my French.</p>
<p class="character">THEO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I play some soothing sounds for you?</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s right, here comes David with an antique radio and a glint in his eye.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What are we meant to do here, David?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">We think we found the refugees in that building. We think that this woman has access keys for the entire place. Leif says he can’t access the basement, so we need somebody on the inside.</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there. Did you get that new upgrade just now?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah, my device switched from a single voice to the voice of two people.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh, I don’t know if I want that.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s great, you should try it.</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was really attached to Theo, though.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure, I get it, but you’ll like it, I promise.</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um, okay.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And why is that, Betty?</p>
<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, well I was saying to Theo that I just don’t feel appreciated there. I work very hard.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a shame.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what are we doing about this, Betty?</p>

<p class="character">BETTY</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that’s what you are.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seems to me that if you’re working hard and not getting appreciated that it’s already a hostile work environment.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey, Gloria. Do you have any of these meat cans back at the diner? This shit is the best.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, Teta, now that I’m thinking about it, I could cube the meat and fry it and then go with a pineapple salsa. Could be something really special.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, Bram, that is three planets down and our team still seems to be going strong.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">993 planets to go, 75 refugees still out there somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, Bram, some people may be wondering, “What happens to all these refugees once the diner comes along and swoops them up?”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Way back, when this group of travelers took their first trip with the diner, they all had to pack themselves into the dining room. But Gloria had a thing or two to say about that, didn’t she?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s always thinking, that one. Now a days, the diner’s precious cargo doesn’t have to sleep in booths or on the floor. They can make themselves a home away from home deep down in the diner’s deep freeze at the newly christened “Camp Vladimir.”</p>
<p class="direction">FIONA CALLS TO A NEW BATCH OF REFUGEES AS THEY APPROACH THE CAMP.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome, everyone! Make your way this way! There’s blankets for everyone over there, get warm by the fire, and don’t worry about the wolves. If you’re hungry there’s a line for soup right there, if anyone needs medical attention let me know. I’m told most of you speak English, so hopefully I’m not screaming at you like an idiot right now.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, who have we got here, Kitty?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Bram, this is Fiona, one of the new additions to the diner. Gloria and the team stole Fiona from a planet that was eternally stuck in the year 2012.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">2012 was a good year, Effie. I’ve still got “Call me Maybe” on my car jams playlist.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now doubt that it’s a banger, Bram. But, it’s been a rough road for Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Heart goes out to her.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then, look at her. As you can see she’s already making herself useful, keeping things running here at Camp Vladimir. Fiona, how are you doing today?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This camp keeps getting bigger and bigger, are you going to have enough blankets for everyone?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Right. They told me you guys were doing some kind of sportscaster thing. They said you do this sometimes.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona, just a few days ago you were a barista at a Starbucks, and here you are criss-crossing the heavens in a diner. Never mind the refugees, how are you holding up?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... well, I’m learning a lot. I know how to start a campfire now, I know how to change a diaper, I learned to never hang out in an area of Andromeda called “The Iron Quadrant?” And I learned that I actually look great in a parka.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes Fiona, but how are you really doing?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How am I really doing?... How am I really doing... It’s funny, I was saved. I was a prisoner on my planet. But there’s this part of me that wishes I could go back. There’s this part of me that wishes I just didn’t know all this... That’s embarrassing to admit. I guess we want to stick with the familiar even when the familiar is terrible for you.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where we come from is always complicated, isn’t it, Fiona?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously. I asked Gloria how she does this. How does she ever feel like she’s home in a place where everything’s always changing? She said she misses having a home sometimes, but that home can be anything. Home can be a person or a mission, or a spatula somehow... I guess I need to start by finding that.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds like you’re on the right track, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, here comes another group, gotta go. Hey, everyone! There’s blankets for everyone over there. Get warm by the fire, and don’t worry about the wolves.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty, what else goes on around here when they’re in-between planets?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, Bram, used to be the time in between shifts was a time for rest and time to get a little chummy with your friends. But these days there’s never a still moment here at the diner. For example, we had an opportunity to head up to the roof where Leif is in constant repair and refashion mode.</p>
<p class="direction">WE ARE NOW UP ON THE ROOF.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, thanks for talking with us today.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you working on right now?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You guys are doing the Sportscenter thing again?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s an awful big gun you’ve got there, Leif, what is it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is Dame Judi Dench, AKA Teta’s gun.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, Leif, how does she even lift that thing?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s a real slab. This model is called a Peace Reaper. It can do ranged combat, mid-range combat, close quarters—it’s even got a grenade launcher and a flame thrower. A lot of people don’t use them because one of the key laws of engineering is: the more things you try to do with one toy, the less chance there is of you doing any of them well. However, she’s made some changes to it that I have to admit are pretty brilliant. Anyway, the sight is fucked up so I need to make some adjustments.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve seen you work on a whole heck of a lot of things up here, Leif. Now that I think about it, very few of them have been guns.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I am proud to say, in the course of my long life I only ever made two guns. And one was to win a contest. I hate guns. Guns don’t solve anything, they just hurt people. You want to make a weapon? Make something that attacks a system, not people.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the parking lot.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, two minutes, let’s go!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry guys, back to the salt mines. Coming down!</p>
<p class="direction">“RAMPING UP TO THE NEXT EVENT” MUSIC START PLAYING.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty, Leif may have done a pretty nice job on that gun but it’s not going to make a lick of difference on this next stop is it?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bram, it is not, because our next stop brings us to Planet Dickson.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, I’m a bit confused by this one, Kitty.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sure is a puzzler, Bram. Now, according to our home team, every planet they’re visiting has found some new method to get people stuck in their ways, and on Planet Dickson they get people going round and round by turning everything into a spectator sport.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid I don’t follow you on that one, Kitty. We love a good spectator sport.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Luckily we were able to chat with Ava and Libuza about this planet right before they were to participate in one of these spectator sports.</p>
<p class="direction">BRAM AND KITTY GO “LIVE TO TAPE” FOR THEIR INTERVIEW WITH AVA AND LIBUZA. THEY ARE IN A GREEN ROOM OUTSIDE OF AN AMPHITHEATER, ABOUT TO GO ON STAGE. WE CAN HEAR A RAUCOUS CROWD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, it’s going to be great.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, Ava, Libuza, can you two explain to us what this is all about? What goes on on this planet?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s super fucked up, check it out: Imagine a game of football, the American kind. You’re watching this game where they take this ball and the kick it and throw it and tackle each other for it and use it to score points on each other.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds like a good time to me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">BUT. Imagine that the ball they’re using in this game of football is actually a really important tool. Something that you need to solve a very important problem.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, then why is it being used as a football?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly. On this planet, knowledge isn’t something to be used and digested and processed to evolve, it’s a blunt object to pummel your enemy with.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do you sound excited about this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, just because we’re mega-geniuses doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy pummeling our enemy.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, hang on there, Ava. Having a whole lot of knowledge is a good thing, why are you saying it’s bad?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because having knowledge means jack shit if you don’t do something with it. Think about Jeopardy back home. There’s a winner every season and they’ve got all this knowledge. But would you call anyone who wins that game a great thinker? How many people on Earth learn things just so they can dunk on people on the internet or “really crush it” at dinner parties? Knowledge is a tool on your belt, not a notch on it. That being said, let’s crush these fuckers!</p>

But, somehow, here we all are. The answer lies in CPT Violation - a fundamental asymmetry in the universe itself. We’ve observed asymmetry in particle physics. I propose that that asymmetry is not isolated, but runs through to the core of our existence in a complete violation of charge, parity, and time symmetry... thank you.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, any time you want to stop looking at my brain is fine by me.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need you to get out of Gloria’s head.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what I mean.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not trying to get into anybody’s head.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kazi, you are constantly, without question, trying to get into peoples’ heads. Sometimes literally. Gloria puts a lot of pressure on herself and she doesn’t need any more from you. You have one conversation with her and suddenly she’s feeling guilty because rescuing all of your people isn’t going to be enough. You’ve got her thinking she needs to save the whole galaxy, now.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t control her mind, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can cut the bullshit, Kazi. When you were standing there in front of that big hologram of Cryptessia, looking at all those planets, I already knew what you were planning.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really? What am I planning?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re going to sweep up the rest of your people in this galaxy but then you’re not going to stop there. You’ve got a great big ship and wormholes that connect everything. You’re going to load up that ship of yours and go planet to planet claiming territory just like dear old dad did.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see. And that upsets you, does it?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes it upsets me. Because we didn’t sign up for a war, Kazi, we run a fucking diner.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m confused, Caspar. Why would it matter what Gloria’s thinking? Nobody seems to be able to control that diner of yours. What difference does it make what I say to Gloria?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look it... I think it listens to her a little bit.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Really?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And if you get her emotionally wrapped up in your war games, then we all get dragged into it. I don’t want that. If you want to be galactic Napoleon, fine. Leave us out of it.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You know, Caspar, despite the fact that I see the inner workings of your brain, I still have no idea how it works. Look at everything you’ve seen the past few weeks. Look at all these people trapped on these planets. How do you see that and decide it’s not your problem?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I’m trying to keep the people I care about safe.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You idiot... The mistake I made, Caspar, was thinking that there was ever a safe place from people like this. I thought we could leave the Triad and start anew, but now look.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hundreds of thousands of lightyears away and it’s no different: a powerful force enslaving the vulnerable. You’re a fool to think you can run from that. There’s no safe space, it always comes for you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kazi, my son is here.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your son? You mean the man who has already picked up a gun and jumped into the fray without any hesitation? He’s very brave, Caspar, I’m assuming he gets that from his mother. You’re going to tell him that it’s time to run for the hills?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’ll forgive me.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, he wont... I’ll be honest with you Caspar, if this is really true, that the diner listens to Gloria somehow; what kind of military strategist would I be if I didn’t exploit that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am asking you to not involve us in this.</p>

But, in a billion years, if they turn those big telescopes around and try and see other nearby galaxies... they won’t see anything.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A billion years in the future, the expansion of the universe will have increased so much, that light from distant galaxies won’t be able to reach us in time. A billion years in the future, the people living in the Milky Way-Andromeda combo galaxy... will think they are the only galaxy that exists. They won’t be able to see the faint light of the big bang, they won’t be able to see the map of the cosmic microwave background. They’ll just be a galaxy in an ocean of darkness. There’ll be ancient books and stories about how scientists used to be able to see the beginning of the universe, but it’ll all be theoretical. It’ll feel like a myth...

<p class="dialogue">That’s very wise.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>

<p class="character">EDITH (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We gather here today not as mere women asking for a favor, but as American citizens demanding what is rightfully ours. For too long have we been told to be patient, to wait our turn, to trust that men – our fathers, husbands, and brothers – would represent our interests in the halls of power. That time of patience has passed.</p>
<p class="direction">THE ROOM APPLAUDS.</p>
<p class="character">EDITH (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look around you. We women maintain the homes, educate the children, work in the factories, tend to the sick, and contribute to every aspect of society. Yet when laws are made that govern our lives, our property, our children's futures – we are told to remain silent. They say we are too emotional, too fragile to understand politics. But I say there is nothing so fragile as a nation that fears women.</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello there ladies. I’m Effie Mucklewain here with my husband Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Evening all.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... I’ll be honest, y’all, I stepped up to the microphone without knowing what I’ll say. But that’s not a new feeling for me. I myself am a Baptist minister and speaking in front of folks is as simple as breathing in and out for us. “Carpe Podium” we like to say in our house.</p>
<p class="direction">A BIT OF LAUGHTER FROM THE CROWD.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I suppose I am here with you today to bless your endeavors. I find them inspiring. The Lord provides, but still leaves so much work for us to do, doesn’t he?... When we struggle for freedom, it is never a struggle to gain new ground, but rather to reclaim that which was taken from us. We struggle not for a new world, but for the world in its true form to cease from being obscured. The untainted world, the unobscured world, is as perfect as a newborn’s face. And it is the charge of evil, avarice, and fear to make that world invisible to us, to make us forget what we have been given by the movements of grace... Also y’all, it pains me to say it, but I believe I have come here this evening with an apology. For that evil, that avarice, that fear, it has at times found an ally in the church where we have happily called our home. Too many times has the war against a woman’s freedom been framed as a holy war. And too many times have those who wield shackles and batons claimed they were men of God. As we work here tonight to unobscure the world’s perfection, let not that work cease at the steps of our holy places. For surely the light of justice seeks out every corner, reaches beneath each stone. So I stand here with you tonight, not with a church looming behind. I stand here with Mary. With Ruth.</p>
<p class="dialogue">With Hagar... I stand here with y’all. I offer my blessings and my adoration.</p>

The war I fought against the Teds was a war of persuasion. It was a war waged in the mind. There were symbolic victories... and there was recruitment. I became very good a bringing a wavering soul over to my side... I’ll spare you all of that because I don’t think you need it... I’ll simply say that this place of yours is a blessing.
