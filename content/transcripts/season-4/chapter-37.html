<p class="direction">JEREMIAH AND GLORIA WALK INTO THE THEATER OF THE PARADISE. THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE, MUSIC FAINTLY PLAYS OVERHEAD AND SEEMS TO CHANGE WITH THE MOOD.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">There she is.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow, look at this place.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is several hundred square feet of beaded, aluminized vinyl. It’s not a silver screen but those can get a little glossy in my opinion. It’s a matte gray finish, not ideal for some films but really gives a nice contrast for black and white movies.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s beautiful.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I first walked in I said “They don’t make them like this anymore.”... Didn’t know how right I was.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Start at the beginning.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright then... Act I.  Establishing shot: Knoxville, Tennessee. 1981.  We see a young man named Jeremiah Franco, 23, rakish good looks (if you don’t mind me saying). Jeremiah is on his way to work with a smile on his face.  He is clean, he is put together, he is smiling. We see on his shirt he wears a name tag: “Noah and Kaiti’s Grocery and Supply, General Manager”. He looks far too young to be holding such an important position.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you going to do this whole story like this?</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Apologies. Old habit... The young man is me. I had decided to skip college. I was a terrible student and my parents had no intention of throwing good money after bad, so it was off to the workforce for me. The go-go 80s had just begun and, I’m ashamed to admit, I was a bit of true believer. Work hard, climb the ladder, get ahead...</p>
<p class="dialogue">For some reason I was applying all of that to working at small, independent grocery store in Knoxville. And within just a few short years I was the general manager. The titular Noah and Kaiti had retired and said enough to Tennessee, they had moved down to Florida and started a weekly newspaper called “The Gabber”. “Helping protect democracy in Florida.” How’s that going, by the way?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t ask.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">So there I was, I was twenty-three years old and was the king of my little corner of the world. Up Next: find a nice lady, have some nice kids, have a nice life... And then one night, I had just closed up shop and there was a knock on the glass. Two young men. Younger than me even. And one of them carried a portable movie projector with him. I thought it was a bit odd, so I unlocked the door and asked if I could help. Kacey Howe and Bryan Barletta were their names. They said that they were making a movie. They had already shot half of it and they had decided to go door to door to local businesses looking for investors to finish the rest of it... I was very confused. Movies? In Knoxville? That’s not where people make movies. That happens in Hollywood. But these two young men had taken a few classes at Vanderbilt and they had decided to hell with it. They were going to make a movie... I should’ve turned them away but, I had to see it. So I invited them inside and we set up in the cereal isle. They projected what they had shot on all of the white cereal boxes... I’ll never forget that. Those ghostly images dancing across the boxes of Corn Flakes... It was a terrible movie. It was about an entire inlet on Puget Sound that had been possessed by an evil spirit. “Lucid Harbor”, they called it... It was forty-seven minutes of footage and I was a changed man by the end of it. They had made something. They just decided to make something and then there it was... They left the store that night with every penny in my savings account... But they didn’t know anyone in town. They were shooting nearby in LaFollette, trying to make Norris Lake look like Puget Sound and they were going door to door. And guess who knew everyone in town? In a few weeks we had the money they needed, about another month of principle photography and then... it was done. We had made a movie. We took it to a horror film festival in Chicago that Spring.</p>
<p class="dialogue">We screened it in front of a crowd of one hundred and sixty-three people... They hated it so much. By far the worst thing at the festival that year. But I watched the crowd watch the movie... They would laugh to each other, yell at the screen, throw popcorn... When the lights came up, nobody in that theater was a stranger... They all had an experience together. It was like they all knew each other now. By that time the next day we were already working on the next one... And that was the next two decades of my life. I produced fifty-three films altogether. All of them outside the Hollywood system, all of them delightfully bad. “Miss Nixie the Space Princess”, “Shadow Rapture”, “Mr. Me, Myself and I”, “The Madness of Dr. Dr. B”, and of course, my personal Laurence of Arabia, “Killer Zamboni”.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They all sound amazing.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a right way to do a bad movie. It’s an art in and of itself.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then?</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then... The internet had just begun its slouch toward Bethlehem at the end of the nineties. The world was changing and I began to feel like a bit of a dinosaur. Kids in film school started having more production power on their desktop than I had in an entire warehouse. The world was demanding that I change with the times and after a few years of giving it a try I decided to, very respectfully, say no. The future was not for me and I was ready to just let it go. Watch it sail off into the distance.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... And then, suddenly...</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">... And then suddenly... I thought I had just spent so much time with my head buried in work that I never bothered to notice this place in my neighborhood, but I turned the corner one day and there was, somehow, a mid-century, single-screen, movie theater. Out of idle curiosity I walked in and... I imagine you know the rest.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And when did the rest of your people come along?</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know how time works here, I really have no idea. But eventually I was on some planet somewhere and along came Leif. He was looking for a new life, as I’m sure yours was too. He didn’t know anything about being a projectionist, but you know how he is with machines. He became handy very quickly.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He does that.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then along came Marguerite and P.J.. Now I had an engineer who could make anything and an astrophysicist who was actually starting to make sense of the place, which I never thought would happen. Others will join us for a while but this is the core group. It’s a good group. We’ve been through a lot together.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Us too.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">And... credits. That’s my story. How about you?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... It all started in the middle of a pandemic that had paralyzed the world. A woman named Gloria locked the doors on her taqueria for the last time, and wondered where life would take her next.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aaaaah. Nice opening.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE LOBBY. AVA AND MARGUERITE ARE GOING A MILE A MINUTE.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, that’s not right.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not right, we’re eating popcorn right now.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Meaning?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, what is cooking?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Something someone brings to me.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s deliberate cellular degradation. You degrade the cellular integrity for greater nutritional absorption in your body. If it was null entropy you couldn’t cook food.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So that shifting point of null entropy you found back then? It’s a shifting point of something but there’s all kinds of entropy going on.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar is 173 years old.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, stuff like that is happening. Trust me. The gray hair had been creeping in for years and it has stopped dead in its tracks, I’m not getting any older, which is amazing because, look at me, I’m in my prime.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And to think I would know all this if I had cooked literally one time in my life.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re such a boon for the Thai food industry though.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s got to be conditional, right?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">With the condition being what?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Consciousness.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hm.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, you remember P.J., right?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Polly Jean, wife of the Dean.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, God.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">P.J., I’ve heard of stepping out on your husband but you’re the first to step out of space and time on your husband. It’s commendable.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did it have to be the first thing you brought up, Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, guys. What the fuck? What happened? What are you doing here?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Well. When last we left our heroine, she had been fired from her lofty university position because she was caught boinking the Dean’s wife.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Heh.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t say boinking.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, for making passionate and meaningful love to the Dean’s wife.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I dumped all of my research off on you and suddenly it was just Polly and me.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had been in a crisis for several years about what to do with my life.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Being married to such a tremendous mediocritite will do that to you.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">But Marguerite was a little new to having a life crisis, so it was an adjustment period.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, there was plenty to do at first, right honey? High five.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But seriously, what do you do when you’re kicked out of the magical kingdom? I’m sure I could’ve gotten some random adjunct position in some little corner of nowhere but I couldn’t imagine stepping up to the chalkboard again. Get this, I even considered becoming a chemist.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The horror.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lab coats?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goggles?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">My husband got all our friends in the divorce and the only person she ever talked to at Cornell was you so it was just us. We were really starting from scratch.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I was very happy.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was too. But we needed to...</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leave the house at some point.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we developed a grand plan.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Let’s go see a movie.”</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And here we are now.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The odds of you and I seeing each other again, this way, it’s a little concerning to me.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right? But then, if you factor in infinity, then there are infinite Marguerites and infinite Avas, so It’s not that huge of a coincidence.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because we’ve met again but...</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not from the same universe.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But here’s something. I think we’re neighbors.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Baby, you came up with a fun name for this, what was it?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Smurfette’s closet.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Remember Smurfette from the Smurfs?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t remember the Smurfs? What were you doing when you were nine years old?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Graduating from High School.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, in the Smurf village Smurfette was the only girl Smurf, everyone else was a boy.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nightmare.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And sometimes she would walk into her little toadstool house and open her closet and she had the same dress over and over again.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So the dresses looked identical, but if you looked really close-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They would all have microscopic differences.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The number of universes seemingly identical to each other are seemingly infinite.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">In some universes the only difference is a tree in Macon, Georgia being on the other side of the street. Changes in these universes don’t have to be extreme. Your mom was a nightclub singer, right?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you still didn’t know your dad.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you still write in that stupid Dutch shorthand.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, all that’s the same even though we’re highly likely from different universes. Oh, AND, the more similar the universe, the closer they are to each other. I think.</p>
<p class="dialogue">You always described it like a string of pearls stretching out to infinity, but do you remember the time I came into your office with all that CMB data?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were always coming into my office with CMB data.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right but you were wearing your hair up and you never do that and I was like “are you wearing your hair up?” And you said “shut up.” And then took it down.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um, babe I’m going to go check on everyone in the theater.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, baby, I love you so much.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love you.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where was I?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The bruise.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes! I said, “look at this CMB data. What are these inconsistencies?” I called it a bruise on the universe. And you had a theory about it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That it was another universe rubbing up against ours.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Like a watermelon that grows with only one side facing the sun, the underside is white and not as strong. There are bruises in the cosmic microwave background where our universe touches another. So rather than a string of pearls, it’s more like a DNA helix, with each universe riffing on the previous one.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that implies a beginning and an ending and the infinite doesn’t do that.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And this is what always happens. We pick up a thread, we follow it to it’s ultimate conclusion and we end up face to face with who? Gottfried Wilhelm goddamn Leibniz again.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’ve been thinking about him a lot lately.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know you have, my little closet philosopher. Ava, you and I know more than any physicist in history. The nature and journey of the universe? Check. Multiverse theory? Check. We’re running out of ways to ask “What is a universe?” Which means eventually we have to face the next question. Not “What is existence?”, But...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Why is this existence?”</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is there something instead of nothing?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is why I hate principles. They can’t be proven. Every time Leif brings up the Principle of Fecundity I throw things at him. There’s no way to confirm PSR.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not for all the other apes out there, but for you? For me? For all the other infinite Avas and Marguerite’s taking a ride on time-traveling, dimension-spanning diners and movie theaters? It’s in our reach, Ava. Not just a theory of everything... the meaning of everything.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What have you got to drink around here?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ha! Come back to our room, I’ve got this stuff from Australia. Wasabi Loob Moonshine. You’re going to love it.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN TO THE PROJECTION ROOM.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, this is where the magic happens.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the projection room, obviously, but as you can see I’ve got about nine projects running right now.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re making a toaster?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m calling it the Resetoaster. It heals burnt toast.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It does?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Theoretically.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE RIBBITS OF A ROBOTIC FROG.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have a robot frog?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. Trash Frog! You know how you land on a planet and you want to do some scavenging? This guy jumps into a pile of garbage and sniffs out rare metals. Trash Frog.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s great idea.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, I’ve been thinking about bringing the drones back, have you got drones?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. Definitely get some. Super useful. I’ve got flechettes on mine.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is this beauty?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. That was here when I got here. It’s a Brenkert Enarc. It’s only 35 millimeter but it’s a beast. Cast iron, lights up the film using an arc of electricity instead of a bulb. I thought about making some modifications but-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s too perfect.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s too perfect, yeah... So, this is crazy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">First time?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been visited by a few versions of myself, you’re the third.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa. How was that?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Confusing.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How about this time?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still confusing.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fair. Where were you when you hopped on board?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Binbar.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Binbar? Jesus, that’s outer Triangulum, what were you doing there?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what I was doing there, I was on the run.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">On the run, from who?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">From who? Everyone.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">After I bugged out on Låfftrax I was hunted by basically everyone.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Teds were trying to find me, then any criminal in The Triad was after me, I had to go pretty deep.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You left Låfftrrax?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. You didn’t?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck no, I’m not trying to get killed.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... When did you show up here?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was right after what happened on Axol.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Axol.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know how it was for you but I took it pretty hard... there were a lot of people on that moon.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I remember.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway, afterwards I was taking it kind of hard and Minsky sent me to Nesso for a while. And after a few days of losing my mind in paradise, I turned the corner and here was this place. I was confused at first. What’s an American movie theater doing on Nesso? I was feeling a little nostalgic so I want inside. I watched this old Burt Lancaster movie called uh... Elmer Gantry. Then I stayed for the second showing. Jeremiah and I started talking and... long story short I ended up staying on... I’m guessing it wasn’t the same for you.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You stayed on after Axol?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like you said, I wasn’t trying to get killed.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long did you stay with Låffrrax?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Too long... Long enough to where getting killed didn’t matter anymore.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where did you go?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Quilandis.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Justine Burbank System?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I figured the best place to hide out was a system that even pirates were scared of. It worked for a while, but eventually I got burned and had to bug out. I was hiding on a Truskan ice hauler trying to find my next move. Disguised myself as a cook. We were stopped at Binbar station and that’s when I saw the diner.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. It was rough though, I sure could’ve used a place like this after Axol.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I am popping the corn dear!</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like we can start eating this popcorn anytime we want. There’s no popcorn rules.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I don’t see that written anywhere in the etiquette books.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Such a poor role model for you child, do you know that, Caspar?</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So...</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So a movie theater has appeared.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Yes and here we are inside it.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought we had a whole conversation where you told me everything.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is new to me. I have no idea what’s happening. I mean, Ava had theorized in the past that there were other diners and other versions of ourselves out there, but we always assumed it was other diners like ours. This? This is new. I guess there’s no reason it has to be a diner.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh. So there’s the issue of the world ending outside.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">But we’re going to watch a movie?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">See, it’s at this point in the process the smart people are talking. When the smart people are done talking there’s usually a list of action items, that’s when we come in.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Time traveling dimension spanning movie theater now.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a little comforting to know that the inner workings of the universe are this ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi there.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We didn’t get a chance to meet outside. I’m Polly.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi there, Polly. I’m Caspar, this is David, and that’s Effie and Zebulon Mucklewain.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Salutations, Polly, My husband would introduce himself but he is currently vexed by the popping of corn.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the kitchen.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is almost ready!</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s the deal with the radio?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You guys don’t have something that talks to you around here?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Long story short, they’re a couple of radio evangelists from the 1920s and they somehow live inside that radio.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, you’d think after 173 years it would stop being weird but, nope. Still weird.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s your weird thing, do y’all have a weird thing?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um. Well, it’s no talking radio but, do you hear that music overhead?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, what is that?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have no idea. It’s always playing and seems to change with your mood. We have no idea where it comes from.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice. Have a seat.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, we’re really going to watch a movie right now?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, it’s weird. It’s Jeremiah’s whole thing, someone comes in the door, tells their story and we watch a movie.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Unless they’re trying to kill us, then Leif usually handles that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, same here.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was so weird to see two of him.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">First time?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Polly, let me ask you something. You all live here all the time?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We do.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So y’all subsist entirely on popcorn, hot dogs, candy and nachos?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, if you couldn’t die wouldn’t you subsist entirely on popcorn, hot dogs, candy, and nachos?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">An excellent point.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey team.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, where have you been?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was getting the grand tour.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It nice. This place used to be a live theater I guess, so there’s dressing rooms. Everyone has their own room.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh man, that’s amazing.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are the smart people done talking?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Ava’s backstage somewhere with Marguerite and the council of Leifs is up in the projection booth.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They better come back with something amazing.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hear you.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Make way!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’ve got Junior Mints, who wants Junior Mints?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where were you?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was at the party backstage, what are all you nerds doing out here?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey baby.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi. Are you eating Junior Mints because you’re trying to hide the booze on your breath?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I’m eating Junior Mints because of how hard I’m going to make out with you during this movie.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, everyone. Hello hello! Well this is really something isn’t it? How are we doing up in the booth?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the projection booth.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ready to go!</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, I’m sure you can imagine, we’ve hosted some pretty interesting characters in this theater over the years.</p>
<p class="dialogue">A Viking wanderer named Arwen the Freer, a retired monster hunter named Lolly, a young man named Tallon Lawson who had just begun his career at a promising new company called “Enron”... we didn’t have the heart to tell him. But this... this is something new. There’s nothing all that special about any of us.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the booth.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Speak for yourself.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Chopped liver over here.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright, alright, there’s nothing all that special about me. But I had begun to think of myself as singular. No one out there knows what I know, has seen the things I’d seen.... But now look. Turns out we have neighbors. And like good neighbors we’re going to help them out in a time of need, but first... first we do a thing that is a bit of a tradition here at the Paradise. We watch a movie. We all get together under one roof and have an experience. I hear tell that the world is coming to an end outside, but it’s not the first time we’ve rolled up on a world on the brink of destruction and it won’t be the last. We’ll need to work as a team and teams need common experiences to bind them together. However, I do know that time is of the essence, so I have picked something nice and short. There was a request from our quite odd friends in the radio for a cowboy film. So I’ll take you all back to the b-movie westerns of the 1930s when movies had the gaul to clock in at about 55 minutes. Those were the days... truly a special day here at The Paradise. And so, without further ado... “The Man from Utah” starring John Wayne and Yakima Canutt..  (YACK-ih-muh kuh-NUT)</p>
<p class="direction">THE MOVIE BEGINS TO PLAY. WE MOVE TO THE ROOF OF THE DINER. BOTH LEIFS CLIMB THE LADDER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, here it is.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice. I always wanted to live on the roof.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">As you can see I’ve got all kinds of shit up here. Blanket emitters, a command center, I can do CMB scans, wave detection, etcetera, but none of it’s been any use because I can’t fix something when I don’t know what it is or how it works.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s got to be something, right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been up here for months racking my brain, Ava too.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’re sure it was an attack? It wasn’t a phenomenon.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think someone tried to sideline us.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you remember a group back in the day called The Sisters?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Sisters? Doesn’t ring a bell.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They weren’t a crime ring, they were freedom fighters, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">When was this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Back in our pirate days.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. But I mean, if it was back in the pirate days...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were pretty drunk the whole time.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Also, there’s always some kind of Ted resistance group out there and they always get squished, I usually didn’t pay attention to them.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This has something to do with them?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They were trying to contact us. They’re old friends of Caspar’s. Right when they make contact, we get hit.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, maybe it’s related but, if someones has the technology to sideline a place like this, some rebels from The Triad aren’t going to be playing on their level. They’d be small potatoes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have no idea who could’ve done this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. But there was this one run-in that Caspar and these Sisters had. They were constantly dodging The Teds but there was this one encounter toward the end. Guns didn’t work on them, grenades didn’t work. I think they may have had temporal weapons.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Time displacement?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. They shot a grenade out of the sky and it just vanished like it was never there. Not all that different from what happened to this diner, I’m wondering if they’re related... It might have something to do with The Egg.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Cryptessia?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s bad.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There be dragons, man.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. But if the dragon is attacking you the warnings don’t mean much.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Cryptessia.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you were in a world of shit when we showed up just now.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">In a lot of ways, yes.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright. Well, let’s see what we can do.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE DISTANT SOUNDS OF THE MUNGO PASSING BY.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit. Mungo.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it showed up when everything was just kicking off so we’ve got a random Mungo here now.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love those things.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who doesn’t love a huge plant-eater?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Unless they get injured. Then they’re terrifying.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ll have to hope for the best on that one. How about I fire up the command center, show you what I’ve got so far.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds good.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF FIRES UP THE COMMAND CENTER.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, you seen our girl lately?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... BertBert?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... last I saw her she had just won a war against The Teds.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. “Empress BertBert”. That’s a good one.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many times have you run into her?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, tons of times. There’s “Empress BertBert, “I’m quitting Journalism BertBert”, “I’m quitting journalism again BertBert”... “Recently Divorced BertBert” can get pretty weird. How about you?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just the once.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Wow. Well, get ready, you never really know what you’re getting when you see her... Always nice though, y’know? It can get so complicated out here but seeing her always makes it feel simple somehow. You know what? Maybe that’s what we need. A little simplicity.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look at you, man. You’re knee deep in like nine things right now. The sisters, the mystery assailant, this Earth is going off the rails, you’re grounded. What if we just pretend the problem is simple?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s just call it a Cadillac. Right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A Cadillac.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If this diner was a Cadillac, it could only be so many things. Transmission, alternator, carburetor. Maybe it’s one of those.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This thing doesn’t have a transmission.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But what’s the equivalent of a transmission for a time-traveling, dimension-spanning diner?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me neither. Let’s find out.</p>
<p class="direction">BACK IN THE THEATER. WE HEAR “THE MAN FROM UTAH” IN THE BACKGROUND.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m having a hard time following this movie, dear, what the heck is happening?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, this man here is John Weston, he’s a bit of a saddle tramp and while he was blowing through town he foiled a bank robbery.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I gathered that part.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The local sheriff has now deputized him to infiltrate a local rodeo that’s up to no good.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also, there appears to be some strange occurrences of the rodeo entrants dying of rattlesnake bites. I suspect foul play.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh, he just jumped right up on that horse, didn’t he?</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s Yakima Canutt. He did all the stunts for this one. He’d go on to lay the groundwork for Hollywood stuntmen for years to come. He’d teach them how to leap on to horses, how to fall down stairs.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">These are the tallest hats I’ve ever seen in my life.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like a meeting of western style Popes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is not a good movie.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no. It begins with John Wayne singing on a horse, of course it’s not a good movie.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are we watching it?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jeremiah has an attachment to it. See that guy in the back there? He’s holding the lasso?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A while back a guy comes in. He’s a down on his luck ranch hand. He says that when he was a young man, he was asked to be a background player in a movie but he never had a chance to see it. We of course had it in stock and so we showed it to him. There he is, Bobby Ray Winland, Jr. He felt like he existed a little bit more after seeing it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Speaking of things existing, the world is ending outside.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, what are we going to do about it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a radical idea.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ohh. Let’s hear it.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you seem like the odd one out in this group.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m glad it shows.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t mean that in a bad way.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not a movie buff or a science person so, yes, I guess I am the odd one out.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d you get wrapped up in all this?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hm. Well, Marguerite was a professor at Cornell and I... I was there too.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did you teach?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I wasn’t a professor.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I was the wife of the dean.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Scandalous.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It really was. I’m not really prone to scandal.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I get that.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t realize it at the time but apparently I kept inviting her to parties and functions without knowing I was doing it. That’s how I, apparently, “Put the vibe out there.”</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah you did.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">After successfully “putting the vibe out there” it was suddenly like I was being hunted by some sort of forest predator. To hear her tell it, I pursued her relentlessly, but I don’t think I’ve ever pursued something relentlessly in my life.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s always the quiet ones.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Apparently my assortment of cardigan sweaters really brings all the girls to the yard.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have two lesbian grandmothers, you have no idea how true that statement is.</p>
<p class="direction">THE FILM COMES TO AN END. THERE IS LIGHT APPLAUSE.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that was really something, wasn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was something.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">When the lights went out at the saloon and the bandits all try to jump him, but then the lights come up and it turns out he had left the room already? They were just giving themselves a beating, weren’t they?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, they were, dear.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright everyone, I realize that one’s not going into the library of congress or anything but it could be much worse.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Could it?</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I like films like these though. They were made a long time ago, before anyone really knew how to make a film. None of them had gone to film school and I think it’s clear that John Wayne is not a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. They were all making it up as they go along.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And here comes the teachable moment.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not unlike all of us. I think both of our groups will admit there is not a manual for the things we do, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important. All we may have is our instincts, like the merry band that made this film. So with that... Gloria?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s really great to meet you all. I’m sure you can see we’re in a bit of jam outside, but between all of us I know that we can do something to at least fix it a little bit. So, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like us all to head outside and try to make sense of the mess we’re in.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have an idea, actually.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">You don’t get special treatment.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Available services? I have no available services, what are your available services?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, bringing you sandwiches, bringing you coffee, bringing you pencils, where do you think your notebooks come from?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, can you give us a rundown of what’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s two problems. One: our diner has been out of commission for eight months now. Because of this, this entire universe has gone haywire because of what, Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">An anti-matter imbalance.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just going from Pasadena to Hollywood, I saw a marching band appear out of nowhere, a talking goat, a stampede of Zebras, a thirty second blizzard, a world war one dog fight, Gregorian monks, and a teleporting lawyer.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Talking goat, you didn’t tell me about a talking goat.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>

<p class="dialogue">Where did it go?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where did what go?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Before we began the cowboy film, there were two moons in the sky.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two moons?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s when we figured we were doomed, Now I just see one moon.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You know, I usually have to sit here and be right all by myself, it’s so nice to share it with you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is nice.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Surprise!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay, you can’t just say surprise.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fixed.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The universe.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s not.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes it is.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a big ass Mungo five blocks away, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you want to see the alerts on my phone? There’s crazy shit still happening all over town.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct, which is why we now unveil our new theory...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The scratch and dent theory!</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Imagine the universe is a car. Not a nice car, just a car that gets you from place to place. Like Ava’s old Audi stick shift. What was it called?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was called Émilie du Châtelet and I miss her every day.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a piece of crap but it got the job done.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How dare you?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you guys having a slumber party or something?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">One break light was missing, there were dents in the fender, and it always pulled to the left.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those were features, not bugs.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava only took it into the shop when it broke down or wouldn’t start.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we restarted the universe, but the scratches and dents remain.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct. Scratches and dents like: a Mungo in downtown Pasadena.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So the headline is: The world is not ending.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">But paragraph three is: Pasadena just has a Mungo now.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also right.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had this theory back at the Horizon Motel, but there was no time to confirm it. We don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Damn, we saved the world just by showing up. That’s my kind of gig.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m a little disappointed. I had a theory in the back of my head for blowing up the extra moon.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice. Core exciter?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, let it blow itself up.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was thinking: spatial distortion right behind the moon. Suck it out into the asteroid belt.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh, that sounds fun.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Didn’t you tell me there was a city on the moon?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, a small one.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’d be fine.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway, crisis number one officially averted.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is great news you guys.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re welcome.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t do anything.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We named the theory.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Names are important.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you named anything today?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It seems like you kind of just sat there and then congratulated yourself.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have no idea how often I feel this way.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">One of the key aspects of this universe was suddenly missing, so things started breaking down. It looks like the Paradise came in like a transdimensional substitute teacher and plugged the hole.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like you're going to be okay.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am? There's Zebras in my neighborhood.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, y'know, they can round them up. I'm sure it can get back normal.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Normal?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds like it’s party time.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on, Leif. Believe it or not, saving the universe is not the only thing on our to do list. Our friends are still stuck here and they’ve been stuck for eight months. So what we need are some plans of action, does anyone in the brain trust have some things we can try?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing so far with us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing here.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, well, you know how I am about these things. We’re here for a reason, so let’s not squander it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if we entangled them?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The diner and The Paradise?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m currently on an “entanglement between dimensions” thing.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds funky.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leifs. What if we entangled the diner and the movie theater?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What would that do?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No idea.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not enough time. I’m assuming these guys will be taking off in twelve hours like us. We’d need to build a lot and make a lot of computations. Maybe if I still had the Urt processor, but not with what I’ve got on the roof.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Crap.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is good though. Keep talking, let’s get everyone inside, I’ll make everyone some food that’s not popcorn.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Urt processor?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah, it was beautiful. I had an Urt quantum processor from 800 years in the relative future.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh man, that sounds beautiful. Fucking Urts, man.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Want to come inside and share a milkshake with me?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s okay, go ahead.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s wrong?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. See, there’s the “nothing” that means “nothing” and the “nothing” that means “something”, I feel like this is the latter.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously, nothing, I’m fine. You should go hang out with Ava, you haven’t seen her in a very long time.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come in with me.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s really okay. There’s a lot for you to figure out, you like figuring things out, this is like Christmas morning for you.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Polly.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m so serious. Nothing bad is happening. I love you. Go inside.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love you too.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re going to share a milkshake later if it kills me.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, fine.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, can you get everyone coffee?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, sure.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You coming in?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m fine. I’ll keep an eye on things at the theater. I don’t think I have much to contribute in there.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Neither do I.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s really fine. Please don’t feel the need to include me.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I’m not trying to include you in all that I was hoping we could sit at a booth and talk about people behind their back.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t sound very nice.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s only mean if they find out about it, Polly. Come on, the coffee’s good.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... okay.</p>
<p class="direction">INSIDE THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would first like to start this meeting by saying that I have allowed you all to sit at my booth with me. Congratulations. Who would like to start it off?</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll go first. I’m late to this conversation but I’ll start with this: if places like this diner and places like The Paradise are essential functions in any universe, how could one of them stop working? That would be like gravity suddenly not working.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A universe is filled with things that don’t work out. Why should this place be any different?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve observed massive galaxy-sized clouds of hydrogen in multiple universes now. Those clouds were supposed to turn into galaxies, but for whatever reason they just didn’t. Something short circuited somehow.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just see that as fuel, though. That’s potential energy sitting there, is that really a breakdown of universal function?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A cloud of hydrogen is supposed to eventually become something else, why does it just sit there in the void while all the other clouds of hydrogen got busy turning into galaxies? Something broke. Things break.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But if that cloud of hydrogen sits there it has no effect on the inner workings of the universe. It’s non-essential. Your diner failed and the whole system failed.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the whole system didn’t fail.</p>
<p class="character">PARADISE LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a Mungo in Pasadena, the system failed.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then you showed up.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">As a response to our inability to function, there was a reaction. A reaction from another universe.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what are we talking about? Are we talking about an inter-universal interdependence?</p>

<p class="dialogue">We’ve all felt this. There’s a moment when we figure something out and we take a step back to think about how cool we are for figuring something out. But when we take that step back we see the lens widening. We see the picture is bigger than we thought.</p>

<p class="dialogue">The more we know the more we need to know.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do we need to know right now?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been looking at all the universes we travel to as having a firewall up between them. But if we begin to see them as interdependent, as interlaced with each other then that’s a bigger picture. It’s an ecosystem.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But an ecosystem can be one system inside of many systems.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. System after system getting bigger and bigger. Planets depending on stars depending on galaxies depending on universes. Now universes depending on each other... Do we stop there?</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re now looking at these universes coexisting within a frame. What’s the frame?</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s beyond the frame? Does every infinite universe exist within something even larger?</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Let’s focus up. The diner is broken. How do we fix it.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Do you want to do this or should I?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We can’t fix it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Why?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because there’s nothing to fix. Look what happened. The Paradise came along and fixed the problem and now... If there’s no problem to fix then there’s no diner to fix.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever vast system we exist in, fixed itself. And if it fixed itself it means that...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That it doesn’t need the diner.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not anymore.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like a public bus from the 70s just sitting in a yard somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If the diner could’ve fixed itself, it would’ve by now. The Paradise showing up is proof of that... We’re done.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay... How do we break it to them?</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you haven’t been traveling with them.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, this is all new to me.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s that been?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... how was your relationship with your parents?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was... tentative?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a lot of friends who don’t talk to their parents much because every time they do, their mom or their dad has gone down some conspiracy theory facebook post rabbit hole and they’d rather just think of their parents as the people they were when they were kids, y’know?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, in light of that, this was all a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a good way of looking at it.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... What’s up?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s. Up.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh, I see, you’re one of those people who like to uh... “Get into it.”</p>

<p class="direction">POLLY JEAN ...</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come on...</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... The woman I love more than anything in the world has spent all day hanging out with a woman she has been obsessed with for years.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Obsessed?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely... She is brilliant, and funny, and mean in all the ways she likes and... The whole thing makes me feel a little bit small.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Polly Jean. Look at you. You think you’re the consolation prize.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">A little bit. Yes. Sort of. I’m glad we were able to show up and prevent your universe from self-destructing and all but, there’s a part of me that can’t wait for this day to be over.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So she’s like Ava? A theoretical physicist?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Astrophysicist.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did she love it?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes. More than anything.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then she met you.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">And she met you and then there was a choice. Keep the career she loves or be with you.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’d she pick?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I think that’s an overly-simplistic way of looking at things.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes. The world is complicated.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The world is complicated.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I watch that old man, all day, bring Ava things. Sandwiches and coffee and sharpened pencils. There’s a neon sign above his head telling everyone what’s going on, but we can’t talk about it because it’s just too complicated.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hm. I see that as pretty simple actually.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do tell.</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know Ava a little bit. She basically raised herself. Put herself through school, created her own curriculum for all her degrees. People who grow up like that, completely on their own terms, they end up having a hard time being told what to do. And they have a very hard time letting other people do things for them. Because it implies they can’t do it for themselves...</p>
<p class="dialogue">She allows him to bring her things all day. What your dad doesn’t realize is that for Ava, that’s the equivalent of wearing a pretty dress and putting on perfume and twirling a parasol. It’s pretty simple, they just don’t know it.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then, it sounds to me like it’s a situation that they just think is complicated but actually it’s quite simple. Where have I heard that before?</p>
<p class="character">POLLY JEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, that’s enough out of you.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s what he always says right before he besmirches the name of Tennessee.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am simply proud of the way that Arkansas has done right by preserving our folk traditions and agriculture. From our pottery to our rug hooks to our watermelons.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Watermelons?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing like a Cave City Watermelon, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m a bit partial to my state that created some of the greatest music ever written, myself, though nothing sets the nation on fire like a nice hooked rug.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll have you know I’ve hooked many a rug that could make a shack look like Versailles.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure you have but I can walk into any joint in the world and hear some music made right there in Memphis.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve played all sorts of music from Tennessee, dear.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve got some pretty good knife skills there, Mr. Producer.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you. A lot of my life has involved “waiting to hear”. You learn to fill the time with whatever you can. Actors go to the gym, producers learn how to cook. Nice to be in a kitchen again.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So all you guys have over there is popcorn and hotdogs?</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We also have nachos and candy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aha.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have to get a little creative. You’d be surprised the amount of things you can cook on a hot dog roller.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Ever regret it?</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, the dreaded “R” word.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No?</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. No, I don’t think I do. I think back to that moment I first walked in the door of the theater. Did I have any idea what I was in for? No, I did not. It was an abduction, in the strictest sense. But then again, when those two young filmmakers knocked on the door of the grocery store, I suppose that was an abduction as well.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once I saw them I really had no choice. And perhaps that’s all life is, just a series of abductions. Being stolen from one life to the next. I suppose I could’ve refused somehow, but you don’t produce movies without knowing your Joseph Campbell. The call to adventure. When the hero refuses the call to adventure they make themself in need of a hero. I was having none of that. Just ask your evangelists over there. All those prophets and holy men. Very few of them chose it. It happened to them.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s true enough. Time and again a great divinity will reach down from the clouds and call you up to a new life. First reaction is always “Who me?” “Are they talking about me? Must be another.” But it’s not for us to decide.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">At times, Effie and myself have felt like a cork in the ocean, haven’t we dear? But then, the things we’ve seen. The places we’ve been brought to. It’s a mysterious alchemy, that. But one that needs no arguing with, I find.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah...</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I know what you’re thinking. “Is it all over now?” Right?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I guess I am.</p>
<p class="character">JEREMIAH</p>

<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE PARKING LOT.</p>
<p class="character">MARGUERITE</p>
<p class="dialogue">At the very beginning of this universe and any universe we’ve been to, something happened. Before even one second had elapsed in this universe, the value of something called the Higgs Field, changed. We don’t know why it happened or how. All we know is that when the value of the Higgs Field changed, it made everything in this universe possible. The universe went from a lifeless thing to a boundless explosion of energy. One day, this universe will return to this lifeless thing. Luckily, because we showed up when we did, that day is now far off in the future.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Things work and then they don’t. And the universe moves on. And I’m afraid that’s what’s happened to the diner. Whatever complicated system we’re a part of, it fixed itself. And it did so without the diner. And now it’s moved on, leaving us with... with just a diner. I’m sorry. I know we all had-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava. You can stop. I know you’re just doing this little presentation for me. I appreciate it. But do you know how many times I’ve had to come to terms with all this being over in the last few months?... This place changed all of us, and I’m grateful for it. But you can all stop having little meetings behind my back about how you’re going to break the news to me.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s time to get on with what happens next. As for me... I’m staying here. This place is mine now. It feels like mine. And I can’t really imagine being somewhere else. It doesn’t travel through the cosmos anymore... but it’s mine. So, what happens next is really a question for all of you.</p>

The river flows through the canals and then back into the river... What if I could take the natural world and just... give it a little polish, a mod or two. Where’s the harm in that?”</p>
