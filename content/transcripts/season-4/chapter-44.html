<p class="direction">WE ARE IN A MASSIVE OUTDOOR GARDEN. A THUNDERSTORM IS IN THE DISTANCE. THE DINER APPEARS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. AFTER A MOMENT WE HEAR LEIF’S DRONES TAKE OFF AND BEGIN TO SURVEIL THE ENVIRONMENT. AFTER THE DRONES ARE RELEASED, TETA MOVES INTO THE PARKING LOT, WEAPON DRAWN.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re clear.</p>
<p class="direction">EVERYONE EXCEPT FIONA AND DAVID WALKS OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT AND HAS A LOOK AROUND.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it weird that this is exactly what I was expecting?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s pretty boiler plate stuff. Dark, ominous, beautiful. Classic space emperor.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can someone help me out? What are we looking at?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s like Leif said. Overcast skies, a thunderstorm in the distance. We’re in some kind of massive garden. It’s huge— several acres. A lot of hedges and topiaries. The garden also has all these smaller buildings in it. Then, directly opposite of us on the far side of the garden, there’s a huge mountain.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not a mountain.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, what the fuck is it?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s where we’re headed.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus, that’s his evil keep or whatever?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not just his evil keep.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a weapon.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think what we’re looking at in the distance is what stranded us in Pasadena.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The mountain is a weapon?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, which is it, is it his castle or a weapon?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Both.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, the mountain in the distance I was describing is apparently a giant castle and also a massive weapon. It’s huge, it reaches above the clouds.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">By my estimation it reaches above the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus. This guy is not subtle.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, what are you looking at?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A bar.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“The Stone Fox.”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come here.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, you better come down.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Coming down.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, Libuza we’re going to head over here.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did she say “a bar?”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What the fuck?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like a shitty dive bar.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is it covered by some sort of force field?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Probably to keep it here. I think we’re looking at another thing like the diner and The Paradise.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You think it’s trapped here?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just like he plans to do with the diner.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, what is this force field?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not a force field.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it- DON’T WALK THROUGH IT- he walked through it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m inside. This isn’t to keep people out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif can you get out of there?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah watch.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF WALKS BACK THROUGH THE BARRIER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">See?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like it’s on display.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Leif, what are the drones seeing right now? What are the other buildings in this garden?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF HAS A HAND HELD REMOTE FOR THE DRONES. HE CYCLES THROUGH THE CAMERAS ON THE DISPLAY.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Shit... There’s at least a hundred of them. Bars, restaurants, a book store— a train station, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">All Earth structures?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No, actually. I see a Furshlick tree out there, a Menite grinder, plus a bunch of structures that I don’t recognize. It’s a whole garden full of places like the diner.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not a garden, it’s a trophy case.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we’re the latest addition.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about all of the people? There must’ve been people living in all these places.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Before we go to meet the big boss man we’re going to check some of these places out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">If it’s all the same to you, I think the three of us would like to get on with this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got you, Libby.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good luck.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">And to you.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ll be right behind you. Hang on guys.</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s the word?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a huge garden full of things like the diner. I guess The Benefactor’s been collecting them.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We didn’t see that one coming.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We did not.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, that’s new information. We’re going to check out these new places, and then we’re going to head in... I really hope this works.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Gloria, it’s not as though we had all the choices in the world laid out before us.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I must say, this plan of yours has a level of... what’s the word I’m looking for?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Crazy.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. A degree to which we’ve never seen before.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks... I hope.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess we’ll just cross our fingers.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, thank you for agreeing to stay behind, I think it’s really helped Caspar’s head.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s no problem.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... stay safe, y’all.</p>
<p class="direction">GLORIA EXITS. AFTER A MOMENT.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I must say, I find it odd that one so obstinate as David would agree so readily to remain with us.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I agree dear. Also, I do believe he is within earshot.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I know he is... David? What have you got up your sleeve?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Moi?</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This brings back memories.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It does?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">My mom used to play gigs at places like this all the time. A captive audience of tens and tens of people.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Reading off the sign.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">“The Stone Fox, When You’re Here, You Hate Your Family.” Not bad.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wonder what version of Leif lived here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Barfly Leif?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oooh, I bet Barfly Leif is messy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t see any sign of me at all. I’m going to see if I can get up on the roof.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the kitchen.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The kitchen’s really small.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to walk around outside, see what I can see.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t go far, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not my real mom.</p>
<p class="direction">AVA WALKS OUT THE BACK DOOR.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, is there any sign of me in the kitchen. How do the spices look?... Caspar?</p>
<p class="direction">GLORIA WALKS INTO THE KITCHEN.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s up?... Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a note on the grill.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Read it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need you to read it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Because it’s in my handwriting.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh.</p>
<p class="direction">GLORIA PICKS UP THE NOTE AND READS.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Not sure who this note is for. With any luck, no one will ever walk in the front door again. If you’re reading this and nothing weird has happened yet, leave now. If you have anything in your life that you value, leave now.”</p>

<p class="dialogue">Jesus.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“For a while I convinced myself that there was a point to all this, that if I hung on long enough I would understand why it’s all happening. Now I realize that it was all just a waste of time, looking for meaning in everything... If it’s too late for you like it was for me, I hope she finds you.”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“She can do amazing things, things that seem impossible. She says she can get me where I need to go, and I’ve decided that I believe her... I’m sorry if you get this note too late, and if you do... hope she shows up.  Her name is...”</p>

<p class="dialogue">Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Signed, Caspar.”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I took Clementine’s deal. She reunited this Caspar with David.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So how did this place end up here?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF ENTERS.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. Nothing on the roof. I don’t know who was living here but it wasn’t me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was me. I left a note. Apparently I took Clementine’s deal.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No shit?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But how did this place end up here?</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it, Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s something you need to see.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE SISTERS. THEY APPROACH A MASSIVE DOOR TO THE CASTLE OF THE BENEFACTOR.</p>

<p class="dialogue">There it is again.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re standing at the massive door to this fortress. The door has the mark of the visitor again.</p>

<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s happening.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do we... do we think it’s him or... is it some sort of cult that uses his image?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You said it before back on the Malthusian Trap. An entire galaxy of Earthlings? A network of stable wormholes? An army of followers with unmatched technology?... It would take enormous power.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our father was powerful, but he wasn’t that powerful.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Was he not? I spent years masquerading as a historian who studied him. He had many names, but The Visitor was the most apt. No one knew where he came from. Half of the DNA in our bodies has no origin point... We have no idea who our father was.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, let’s go and see him.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What is this place?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="dialogue">... It’s a Bingo Hall?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome to the Knights of Halifax Bingo Hall.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A time-traveling, dimension-spanning, bingo hall.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">B, I, N, G, O.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, a time-traveling, dimension-spanning diner didn’t sound stupid until just now.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did you need us to see, Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need Leif to take a look at the wall over there.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?... Oh...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What is that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">They look like shadows, what are they?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re shadows... they’re burn shadows.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s a burn shadow?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">When a target is hit by a very sudden thermal attack it can leave their shadow burned into the wall. You see it at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, you see it at Vesuvius.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Each shadow has a pile of ashes in front of it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They were killed here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who were they?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Four shadows, all hominid shaped...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It’s us.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This isn’t how it looks when the Mystery Men kill someone.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wasn’t them.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Over in The Stone Fox I left a note saying I took Clementine’s deal. I guess this is what it looks like when we don’t take the deal.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Damn, she killed the shit out of us.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This doesn’t make any sense, when we met Clementine she had never heard of us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was the Clementine we met.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Infinite timelines...</p>

<p class="dialogue">Infinite Clementines.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, do me a favor and never say the words “Infinite Clementines” ever again.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So the Caspar in the Stone Fox takes Clementine’s deal, and the Stone Fox ends up here. These four versions of us get fricasseed by Clementine, and then this place winds up here.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do those two places wind up here in this garden. How did any of them?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, but I don’t think he’s collecting them because he likes nice things.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay guys. That’s enough sight-seeing. Let’s get the show on the road.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>

<p class="direction">DAVID EMERGES FROM THE DINER WITH THE MUCKLEWAINS IN HIS CELL PHONE.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, here’s how I see it. One of the few advantages we have over these guys is, they still think that you two are incapacitated. So now, here you are inside my phone, and they are none the wiser.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s very shrewd of you, David, but what exactly will we be able to do with this advantage?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is my question as well, David. Gloria has laid out the plan as clear as day, I’m not seeing an advantage to be pressed.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">See, the problem with you two is: neither of you have ever made art, illegally, at night.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is true, but I don’t see-</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes you need to leave the house without a plan. You fill up your backpack with paint cans and a thermos of cheap wine and you just let the night take you where you want to go.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, Gloria’s plan is very specific-</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Father.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’ve dreamed of this moment for eons it seems. I left so many of my children behind in Andromeda. Such a shame to watch so many of them succumb to the vicissitudes of linear existence. I told myself again and again that the truly great ones will seek me out one day, so that we many be reunited. I nearly lost faith. But now, here we are. You three are the most exceptional of all my lineage, for you stand here in my dining hall. And we are reunited at last.</p>

<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Laughing.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... I imagine by this late hour that you’ve deduced certain things regarding my origin. I am not, as previously thought, an enigmatic conqueror. Or at least that is not all I am. What I am is far more complex, but also much simpler.</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was a time before time. A time before space. Before gravity, before all of it. And it was in this time that I was, for lack of a better word, born.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then suddenly all things moved from a realm of pure existence to... well, all of this you see around you. I stood and watched as the universe took shape. I bore witness as particles gained mass and exploded. I watched the universe decide what to be and then become it. All of it was quite a surprise. At first it was all heat and chaos, then a haze of gasses, and then, one by one, the stars emerged. Pinpricks in the curtain of night, all of it suddenly looking back at me. Then came a great dance as gravity began its processional. The stars moved toward each other, coalesced into galaxies. Then the oldest of the stars turned into dark knots in the sky. Endless vortices consuming all. A stunning mural, all of it.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Not in the least, dear. It was yet another one of my plans. Sadly, a failed one.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a thriving empire, you really see it as a failure?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">A thriving empire was simply a healthy bi-product. It was never my true goal all those years ago.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was your true goal?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">All of you, of course. My children. They weren’t calling me Krok the Propigator for nothing, dear.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were your goal?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And you turned out brilliantly. In the end I found that, though spreading my genetic code throughout the universe was a solution to my problem, it simply was not a scalable solution, so I felt it was time to move on. But all of you, really, such a beautiful mistake.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Back home they see you as a legendary liberator, when in fact you were just trying to spread your seed throughout the cosmos.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s disgusting.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Motherfucker’s setting up franchises.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">From this point on, please try and remember that, though my tactics may seem dark, I have always had one bright goal through it all. For the lion’s share of my existence I have had one aim alone: preservation.</p>
<p class="dialogue">As the universe sought to define itself, I found that, as a being who existed before the universe, I was not bound by the new laws it had made for itself. Time, the destroyer of all, could not lay a hand on me. Space was mutable. I could, in one moment, have the lightness of a feather, and then in the next, pull stars into my orbit. Because I was sat outside the ebb and flow of the universe, I could see it in ways you could not imagine.</p>
<p class="dialogue">At the beginning of the universe I could glimpse something I had never before seen: an ending. This luminous universe that had just been born before me had only one path... entropy, darkness, death, nothingness.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Throughout the universe, these things are seen as inevitable. “All good things come to an end,” as the Earthlings say. They are not inevitable to me. I had come to love the universe, and that which we love must be protected.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re trying to save the universe.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That I am, dear. But that is no small task, even for one such as myself. And that was compounded even further by my next discovery... that there is not one universe, but many. I then learned to travel through this great multi-verse. Surely, out there, somewhere, there was a universe that had learned how to circumvent its own ending. But alas, no. Despite the infinite nature of existence, it all travels toward an end. It left me with no choice but to seek out a new way for any universe to exist. A universe of balance. Of calm. A universe that is not so enamored with its own ending. I swore to use every ounce of my power to make it so.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I would need allies. Who would aid me in this fight? And then, just as the stars came to life in the universe’s beginning, there was a new light coming into being. Bright spots in the darkness again... minds. Sentient minds, like my own, began to emerge in the universe. Primitive, to be sure, but, like myself, they could see the universe as I did. They could perceive its beginning and its end— contemplate it, dread it. I would make them my allies, and together we would make the world.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You really see all those enslaved people as your partners?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had already attempted partnership, dear. All those years ago in your galaxy, I was Krok the Propigator. Conqueror for the downtrodden. With might and with wisdom I would create a paradise in which we all could live.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s exactly what you did.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what happened? Where is that paradise now? It was rejected by them. No sentient mind will sit when the work is all done. Given a paradise for long enough, any sentient mind will turn it into a prison. There is something in them that rejects satisfaction. A new way must be found. And I found that new way forward in the unlikeliest of places.</p>

<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... Let us pick up right where we left off. Before you arrived, I was explaining to my daughters how all of this came to be— this strange empire of mine.</p>
<p class="dialogue">As you all know, I was once a man they called Krok the Propigator. I was a conqueror of legend. A benevolent king. A husband. A father. And due to a series of unforeseen complications, my empire came tumbling down.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you abandoned it.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it had failed... I was quite distraught. As you all know I have been searching for a way to save this universe and others like it— a way to bend time’s arrow into a circle... Balance in all things. And as I left my empire to crumble and left my daughters and their siblings behind, I began to wander the cosmos. I had such power and yet I found myself powerless to bend the sentient mind. It was, somehow, not enough to provide paradise. There was a missing element to my plans and it confounded me. So I wandered. And where did my wandering take me, would anyone like a guess?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Earth.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct, Doctor. There I found myself on Earth. Just a shrub of a planet, really. Not much to it. The dominant species was short lived and quite barbaric— no real accomplishments to speak of... But one day I found myself in a ruined city. One of your little wars had broken out and an ancient city had been obliterated. Citizens were gathering up what was left of their lives and running for the borders before another volley of fire came down from the sky. In those abandoned streets, I began to hear a voice. I followed the sound to one of those ruined buildings and I stepped inside. It was a theater. Three people sat in the seats. One man stood on stage, a text in his hand. He read to the others... telling them a story. Death could’ve come at any moment, but rather than run, there they all sat. I was astounded by it. They should be running for their lives, but instead they took refuge in a story that they shared together... I’d never seen anything quite like it... Their reality was grim, their lives in danger. The best they could do was flee the city with all the others— but there they sat... they would abandon their reality for a story they could share together... You see, every race has it’s crowning achievement. On Teta’s planet they are all warriors, the most fearsome you’d ever face.</p>
<p class="dialogue">On Libuza’s planet they learned to listen to the cosmos itself. Kazi’s race had learned the art of wondrous and terrifying transformation. And for the Earthlings... the stories you tell. An Earthling will abandon all facts, all figures, all safety for the sake of a well wrought story. Stories of heroes and villains and beasts and unrequited love, it’s truly fantastic stuff. I have never encountered a race so adept at staving off reality as you all are. The terrible men you diefy, the ugliness you beatify, the murders you transform into poetry. It’s astounding. And it is with this aspect, I thought to myself, that I shall finally save the universe.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Just chiming in here as the resident idiot, but I have no idea what the fuck you’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, but you absolutely do, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I do, huh?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course. Look at the story you tell yourself. Over a century ago you were, due to no fault of your own, abducted by a mysterious construct from beyond space and time. And over the ensuing decades, said to yourself that if you hold on long enough, this random and unfortunate happening will somehow reunite you with the son that you had lost.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It did reunite me with the son I had lost.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar. That boy is not your son. You met him, for the first time, just a few short months ago... But what is the story you’ve been telling yourself?</p>

<p class="direction">WE SUDDENLY HEAR THE VOICE OF YOUNG LEIF.</p>
<p class="character">YOUNG LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know Earth is a backwater caveman convention but as it turns out, I was one of the smartest guys living there. So smart that I invented something that would change everything. At the bottom of an abandoned gold mine I performed a miracle. I pulled energy out of nothing. Like a magic trick. A thirty million dollar magic trick. The first time my team saw all the lights come up on the energy register they all cheered, lost their minds. We had just changed the world... In that moment of monumental change, all I remember is fear. It was terrifying for me because I suddenly realized: “Oh no. I’m going to have to be the unlimited energy guy for the rest of my life.” I would have to make speeches and inspire people and have books written about me. What if I didn’t want to be that guy? What if I just wanted to make something cool and then move on?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re not disappointed in Earth, Leif. You’re disappointed in yourself for being young and stupid... And then there’s the doctor. The one above it all. The one who sees existence as simply fermions and bosons. But rest assured that none of you feel things more deeply than this woman. None of you strive more fervently for meaning than the one of you who insists that there is no meaning at all... Do you not see the power of the stories you tell yourselves? Do you not see how thoroughly you rebuke the reality that presses down upon you? Do you not see how powerful it is? It is perhaps the most powerful force in any universe... I shall do great things with the Earthlings that I have made. Together we shall rebuke the reality we have been given, and make the universe anew.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now who’s telling themself a story?</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like an old arcade. “The Warp Zone.” Kind of appropriate.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What goes on in a place like this?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just another stop in the long progression of places a human being hangs out. When you’re a kid it’s places like this, an arcade with a shitty drink machine. Then you get older and move on to bars and coffee shops... I mean, I imagine, anyway. There weren’t a lot places like this left when I was a kid but I bet Caspar hung out in them all the time. Looks like there’s no power, so you can’t tell, but each one of these big things would light up and there would be a different game you could play.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure all sorts of evil plans were hatched here by the youth of the world.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, you have to hatch your evil plans somewhere. Where was it for y’all?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We had no evil plans to hatch when we were young, David, we were very well behaved children.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh. But where was it? C’mon, school lets out and everybody goes somewhere out of the prying eyes of adults.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I suppose that was Dan Gentry’s old cabin.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, well, I suppose that’s true. Dan Gentry had his land bought by the state so they could build a state road through it. Took the money he made and scooted off to New Orleans, never heard from again. His cabin was in disrepair and fell in a storm, but the fireplace still stood and two of the walls. We’d end up there from time to time.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The young boys had a tendency to settle their grievances there, hopefully with a rock skipping contest and not with fisticuffs. Dear, you hid your slingshot there.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why yes, that is true. I had a slingshot that my mother did not approve of, so I kept it there amongst the rubble.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">All these buildings... they’re all public places.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you mean, David?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">A diner, a movie theater, an arcade. It’s never just somebody’s house or something. It’s always a place people go to.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, that is true, isn’t it? I do find that to be deliberate.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">One can go their whole life without knowing their neighbor. If, in the morning, one turns one way and their neighbor turns the other, they may as well be a hundred miles apart.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Something special about a crossroads. Something sacred about those places where lives intersect. Much harder to make a man your enemy when you share the same space.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">How come we haven’t seen any churches?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is a bit odd, isn’t it? Then again, for a diner you need a kitchen. You can make a church out of any old thing.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Many a fine sermon cometh from the corner of one’s kitchen table, David.</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine that arm isn’t either and it’s making quite a spectacle of itself.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Which way did it go?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a squirrelly little thing, ain’t it?</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE ARM KNOCKING ON A WALL AND JUMPING UP AND DOWN.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">There it is.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, have we not seen an appendage such as this before?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have we?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I seem to recall-</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even Older Leif.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">For a time, we kept company with another one of what appears to be myriad Leifs.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Only this one was much older and he’d been through quite a life. He had himself a left arm that wasn’t nothing but metallic parts.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hear tell he could unhook it from itself and it had a mind of it’s own.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s some older version of Leif around here somewhere?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well if there is, he’s down one arm.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What in the world is it doing?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s knocking on the wall and... does it need our help?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It would appear to.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Help with what exactly?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure, but it does appear urgent.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It keeps knocking on the wall.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That ain’t no wall, that’s a door.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’s giving me that “I ain’t a wall” feeling.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not a real feeling.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I suppose it needs our assistance.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, give it some assistance.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure how we do that, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t you guys just pray and then things happen?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I would argue that’s an oversimplification of the role that prayer should play in one’s life-</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh dear, who are we kidding? Of course that’s what happens.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then whip your bible out, make something happen.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Give me your hand, dear... Lord, we beseech you standing outside this door pretending to be a wall, and we ask that you aid us in returning this lonesome appendage to it’s rightful owner.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes. You’re fond of chickens on your planet, are you not? It’s a veritable chicken holocaust back on Earth, what would be more fitting? Please, enjoy.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So... how does this work exactly?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you be more specific, Doctor?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“To bend time’s arrow into a circle.” That’s what you said.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want to fundamentally change how the universe works.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And so you’ve set up this galactic petri dish, trying to find the perfect way to do that.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">By controlling the minds of humans.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah. I thought I’d encounter your particular brand of cosmological fatalism, Doctor. You, of course, believe that the universe is an uncaring tide of particles carrying us along. You believe that the universe is... how did you put it?</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE VOICE OF AVA IN THE INTERRODROME.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From recording)</p>
<p class="dialogue">How it works is: people like to say that the universe is a harsh and uncaring place, but for the universe to not care about you is to assume that it ever considered you in the first place. The universe? It doesn’t notice you. It has never considered you. You are not on its mind. You are just a particular configuration of dust. You are a rounding error. You are the least of the universe.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You believe the universe would carry on without us, were we not here. That the universe careens toward an end wether we observe it or not.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are incorrect, doctor. The mind of the observer is essential to the life of the universe. You’ve seen this yourself on your planet, in your dalliances with quantum physics.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The universe behaves as a very different thing when it’s being observed, does it not? An observing mind guides a universe. Shapes it. If one controls the observing mind, they control the universe.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You cannot control the universe just by thinking about it.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not alone, no. Not even I can do that. But a galaxy of minds thinking in unison, that is something else entirely. Two galaxies? Three? A million? Then things begin to change. Then you begin to shape it to your will.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even if that were true, it’s an impossible task.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">For one so short-lived as yourself, of course it is. But I have billions of years to enact my plan.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there’s only one thing standing in your way.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are many things standing in my way, Leif. You just saw them on display in my garden. Curious little constructs flying through the multiverse like antibodies, all in ridiculous forms. Diners, bars, cafes, adorable little bookshops. They are ridiculous and they confounded my work. They needed to be stopped. But I was a very busy man. I had not the patience to seek them out myself. So I made a weapon.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your weapon didn’t work, we escaped Pasadena.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not that weapon, Leif. The first weapon. I’m sure we all remember this song of the summer...</p>
<p class="direction">WE SUDDENLY HEAR CLEMENTINE’S VOICE.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Time is the substance I am made of. Time is a river that sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me... but I am the fire.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine was incredibly efficient. She felt inexorably drawn to constructs such as yours, and when she found them, she offered a simple choice to those within. She would give you your heart’s desire or she would give you oblivion. And in universe after universe it worked. These constructs were all abandoned one way or the other. And when they were abandoned, that’s when I could remove them from the board.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The diner doesn’t work when nobody’s inside it.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct. When they are abandoned, they sleep. For eons sometimes, until they are discovered again. And when they sleep I can bring them here where they will never be discovered. The process was very efficient. Clementine was my hunting dog and I, the hunter. But then...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then we defeated Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s correct, Leif. In universe after universe, Clementine was successful... until she met you all. And then, after she was defeated by you, it was as if the spell had been broken. She was defeated time and time again, as if all these disparate constructs were learning from each other... There is something different about that diner of yours. I’m not sure what. But it’s no matter, because now I have it. It shall sleep here forever and I may continue my work.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what happens to us?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You shall remain here as well. You shall be my guests here on my planet for the remainder of your days. Please don’t see it as a prison. I shall provide you with everything you desire. Kazi, Libuza, Teta, you may all be released. I shall return you to your ship and you may go with my blessing.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why not let us go with them?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">An abundance of caution. The good doctor does excel at finding these constructs in the wilds of the universe, I can’t have you released only to trouble me again. My daughters may leave because I love them, and also because I find the work they do to be irrelevant.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stick with the plan.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So tell me, Dad. What’s this going to look like? This perfect universe of yours. Sounds kind of boring, if you ask me.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid that to describe a universe that is outside the reach of time and space is nearly impossible to one such as you, Teta.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Boring.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why couldn’t I see you?... I’ve been blaming myself for not knowing you were there. I could see everything else coming but not you.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No need to blame yourself, dear. It is not simply my origins that obscure me from your vision. I’ve taken many precautions so that my work was not disturbed. It’s why I’ve gone to such pains to eliminate your friends and their insufferable diner. Always, in my endeavors, there were these constructs. Stumbling haphazardly into thwarting me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not stumbling haphazardly. You don’t think we do this for a reason?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know of reasons, and I do not care about your reasons. I care about mine. You seem to think of yourselves as helpers. As samaritans. Allow me to pose this question: Is it helpful to unmoor the raft from the reeds in the river if all that awaits is a waterfall? All these people you claim to be helping, they are all headed for darkness and oblivion. Aren’t all of you exhausted? The rise and fall of empire, the ebb and flow of disease, the interruption of paradise by the serpent? I know you’ve all felt it. That unease. “Oh God, another year.”</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if you’re doing it to yourselves? What if the decay of all things is not an immutable law? What if, my friends, we make the world?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it all sounds fascinating until I remember that you’re torturing an entire galaxy.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, there is that. Unfortunate. Grist for the mill, I’m afraid. Should I not sacrifice one galaxy to save countless others?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t feel saved. Any one else here feel saved? When does the saving start? That sounds nice.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Patience, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your whole plan hinges on you being right. Are you right?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure? History’s full of people apologizing for their “solution” to society’s ills. They all say they’re right at first.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe I’m a bit different, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They all say that too. Everything hinges on you being right— and if you’re wrong? You’ve created trillions of souls only to torture them. They will not be open to hearing your apology.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I will be thanked. In the end.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the end... In the end... Ever waited tables, Krok?</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you being serious?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve done it my whole life... It’s interesting, waiting tables. It’s psychologically very interesting. People are nice, generally speaking. But for some reason when you sit them down at a table in a restaurant, this thing takes over. Because they suddenly have a little power now, right? Now they can decide wether or not you get a good tip. They’re suddenly sitting in judgement of your performance. You give them a little bit of power and that’s when they start to have ideas.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Why isn’t she doing this? Why isn’t she doing it the way that I would do it? Can you believe the service in this place?” Lots of ideas. And the ideas, of course, come mostly from people who have never waited a table in their life... I’ve spent a lot of time in my life having to deal with people who have power over me. And they always have lots of ideas. And you know what I don’t think I can take any more of? People and their fucking ideas. I’m so sick of it. It’s just a battlefield of ideas out there, and you know what? I don’t think I’ve ever had an idea in my life. I just helped people. I brought them some food or a cup of coffee and moved onto the next table. And then along come the people with power and ideas. All they do is make my life harder... Someone as powerful as you, do you have any idea how much unmitigated joy you could create if you stopped having ideas and just helped people?... I’m so sick of it... You’re holding three children hostage. Release the children and let’s get on with this.</p>
<p class="character">KROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anything else, Gloria?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your chicken was dry. Let’s go, everyone. We need to say some goodbyes.</p>

<p class="character">CYBORG DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because we had been sleeping in a storage space for two months.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are you telling me this?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, they’ve got you set up in the ship. Nice little room apparently.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I heard.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Listen I know the sisters are all super powerful geniuses but they’re just as full of shit as anybody else, okay?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You went on a little adventure today?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was trying to save the day.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... that’s admirable.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">This can’t be how this goes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... David, sometimes you just fucking lose. It doesn’t matter how good you are or how right you are or how strong you are. Sometimes the tide just rises up and fucking clobbers you. You could get mad about it if you want, but you’ll never end up getting mad at the right person or thing. The only thing you can do when shit like this happens is just reach out. Try and grab onto something that’s still there. And if there’s nothing there you reach further and further until you find it. Because amidst the waves of defeat and injustice you will always find something out there that will outlast it all. I’ll try and do that if you do.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Are you coming back?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m coming back... I was always coming back.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I was too.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Mucklewains, they’re not going to know you’re not in the radio.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s well heard, Caspar. There’s all sorts of places out there we can make our home.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We shall, my friend.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, because apparently it would kill your father to find a Blackwing or two.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re fun!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, take this bag. It’s dried chilis. Apparently there are no aliens out there that know how to do spicy.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take this. This is a picture of me and you and your mom. It’s been in my wallet for literally a hundred years so it could use a change of scenery.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... I feel strangely calm right now and I don’t know why... It feels like I almost lost this place about a hundred times in the past year. But then suddenly I stopped being afraid of it. I stopped being afraid of losing something I cared about and it was replaced with, I don’t know, this weird certainty. Like nothing could take it from me. I don’t know what to call that feeling.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s faith Gloria. Always has been. Now, I say that to you and you think I’m talking about God, but it’s apart from that. I’ve thought much about faith throughout my life, as I’m sure you can imagine. I’ve seen it everywhere. Outside of the realm of the church, in every day life. I’ve seen people have devout faith in all sorts of things. Look at Leif there. A faith in there always being a way, a faith in solutions. There’s Caspar, a faith in tomorrow. Ever forward. That way. Then there is Ava, who thinks we don’t notice that at the beginning of each of her notebooks she writes a little something: Et quid amabo nisi quod aenigma est.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what shall I love if not the enigma.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">A faith in the unknown. And then there’s you Gloria. An unerring faith in all of us... It’s just a letting go, is all. A peace within you. A trust that wraps itself around you. You need not know what it is. Not sure if even I do.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everybody remember those feelings, okay? That’s how we get back.... David. We love you very much... It’s time to go.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">... See the thing is, I don’t really listen to what people say. I look at what they make. Back on Earth, we love to talk about peace. Peace on Earth, goodwill toward men— we say it every year... But what do we make? Weapons, mostly... on Earth if one guy presses one button, the whole planet goes up in flames. But we love to talk about peace... this gun wasn’t meant for me. That huge weapon behind you, the one you shot down the diner with, that wasn’t meant for us. You’ve wrapped this entire solar system in a shield. A shield? For you, the almighty Krok? To protect you from what? What are you scared of, Krok?</p>

<p class="dialogue">... I fear nothing.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey Fiona. If you’re hearing this, our plan worked. We kept you hidden in the diner, and it was able to escape... You saved the day Fiona. Now the hard part starts. We’ve all got some messages for you. Here’s Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Fiona. So, quick breakdown on Peter. He’s completely autonomous— he’ll know when to recharge and when to do maintenance. I’ve programmed him with several basic commands for you. You’ve got sentry mode, zone defense, shadow, death blossom-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">-yeah, sorry, there’s a full list up on the roof, check it out. The command center is all shut down— I’m the only one who knows how to use all that stuff anyway. But even though it’s all shut down, do yourself a favor and spend some time up there. You can even sleep in the hammock if you want. I’ve spent my life under a whole lot of stars and I can guarantee you there’s nothing more beautiful than the sky when the diner is traveling. It’s different every night. No repeats. But then sometimes you’ll see a galaxy you recognize sailing by. Maybe a nebula or two. They become old friends... Oh, and, under the front counter is something called a Purple Nullifier. Don’t touch it. Here’s Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi there, Fiona. Your main concern during this time will be to keep people out of my booth. I realize it looks like a mess in there but everything is exactly where it needs to be. However, I have left you a notebook and a pencil. Because guess what, Fiona? You’re a scientist now. Being a scientist isn’t about going to school. In fact, some of the best ones never went to school. It’s about the way you see the world. It’s about curiosity and, in my case, obsession. Write down the things you see. Keep writing them down. Eventually in all those things you observe, something immense and mysterious emerges. A similarity in all things. One great thread that you follow into the darkness. You can miss it if you’re not looking close enough. You definitely don’t want to miss it. Okay, here’s Dummy.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, Fiona. Loneliness... Fiona, I don’t know when we’re going to be able to make it back there. Considering how that thing works, it could be a long time for us or a short time for you, or both, or neither. You may be in for a lot of long nights alone. Try not to let it get to you. The thing is, you can be lonely in a group of people. I’ve done it many times.</p>
<p class="dialogue">What that means is, if you can be lonely with all sorts of people around, you can also be alone without being lonely. There are all sorts of ways to do that. For me it was ketchup bottles, and napkin holders, the fucking parmesan cheese. The work right in front of me became my friend, because it was always there. The next day became my friend. It was always there. No matter what you do, just keep going. Okay here’s the Mucklewains.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well, Fiona, we were putting work towards finding you a nice little bon bon from the bible to help you though this time, but nothing felt quite right.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, Fiona, sometimes it’s best to set aside the books and speak from one soul to another.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what we’ll say to you on this, the first day of your new life is, do not forget the mission.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what is that mission, you might ask? Nothing too trying, no journeys up the mountain or down into the deeps.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s simply to reach out to another. All sorts of people will be walking in that door of yours and their needs will range from the simple to the absurd.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there you shall be. And you’ll look this way and that for the one who’s set to handle this mission, but on your left or your right will be no one. It will just be little old you.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there will always be that moment where you say to yourself, “Gol Durn, this is up to me.”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And it’s a sobering moment. That moment when the heavens points its finger to you.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It ain't a duty you signed up for or would wish on another, but there it sits in your lap, waiting for you to do something about it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a sacred duty. Sometimes a burden. But the task of connecting with another and letting their life into yours now sits with you.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You must try not to shirk that duty, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And more importantly, see that duty as a privilege.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">May the Lord bless you and keep you, Fiona.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Remember that walk-in where I kept you captive for a while? Well, you’re going to learn a lot in that walk in. See, when I started walking in there, the things I found in there started to change. Like it knew me. All the ingredients I knew how to use were suddenly there— it was giving me everything I knew how to use. I’ll give you an example. Caspar, what did the walk-in give you?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me?, Uh, white bread and ham. Mayonnaise, lots of mayonnaise-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You get it. The other thing it does, though— it shows you where you’ve been. You’ll see an ingredient and you’ll think “Oh yeah, I know how to make that.” And you’ll remember why you know it and who taught you to make it. It’ll show you your life, if you let it... I’m sorry about this, Fiona. I bet you were wanting a bigger victory than this. But sometimes survival has to be the victory. Sometimes you need to choose what victory is. Sometimes victory is just the next day. But it doesn’t have to stop there.</p>
<p class="dialogue">First, little victories, then bigger ones, and bigger ones, until one day, with all those little victories behind you, you’ll look around and see that the fighting is finally done. One day the fighting will finally be done. And you can sit down and have a look at the world you created. It’s out there somewhere, Fiona. We’re on our way.</p>
