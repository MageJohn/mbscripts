<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A THOUSAND RADIO FREQUENCIES COLLIDING AND THEN SLOWING COALESCING DOWN TO THE SOUND OF THE ECHOES OF A UNIVERSITY HALLWAY. WE HEAR THE SHARP SOUNDS OF HIGH HEELS WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY, TENTATIVE AT FIRST, THEN PICKING UP SPEED. A DOORWAY OPENS AND WE HEAR THE TAIL END OF A LECTURE IN A LECTURE HALL.</p>

<p class="dialogue">The chief problem with the South American Continent when it comes to the work we seek to do is this: erasure. First, there is the erasure of the jungle. Historical structures, even if they were made of stone and not the timber that’s plentiful there, can be swallowed whole by the jungle inside of ten years. That’s a blink of an eye to an archeologist. Second: the erasure of plunder. The continent was raided for plunder so many times during the colonial era that important relics have been scattered across the globe now. You can find them in Arabia, you can find them in Malaysia. I found an Incan idol in the hands of a Russian fur trader one time. So when we cross the equator looking to do the work we intend to do, we must understand that we are looking for sand castles at high tide. With every day that goes by we lose a little more of the story of that entire continent... Alright, that’s all for today.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Tomorrow we start on Pachacutec (pah-chah-KOO-tek). It’s going to be a considerable amount to memorize, so I suggest you empty your heads out before class tomorrow. Mr. Davidson, you should have no problem with that.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Is Leif’s monitor working? Can you see what I’m seeing?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s only black and white. It’s kind of like watching an old movie, but I can see what you’re seeing. The black and white is kind of appropriate actually, it looks like you’re somewhere in Earth’s past. Judging by the clothes it’s looking like the nineteen-forties.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is a University?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Hey, Ava? Look at this, can you recognize where she is?</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(In Libuza’s ear.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me see... Oh, that’s fucking Harvard. See the symbol on that guy’s blazer? Pretty old though. You’re right, it’s probably the forties.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was that like?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The forties?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(In Libuza’s ear.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is definitely during war time. That class should be full of dudes, but there’s only a few of them. They’ve probably been called up. In the forties, you could only defer the draft if you were studying a science. She’s talking about Pachacutec. He was an Incan emperor. That’s not a science class.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... what is all this about? This isn’t what I was expecting.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Libuza, The Mucklewains have gone through a long process of figuring out what the hell they are. It all started one day when Gloria accidentally knocked over the radio.</p>
<p class="dialogue">They seemed to retreat into these various fantasy worlds— I think it may have been a way of protecting themselves. Then, later on, they figured out how to do it on command. That may be what’s going on right now— protecting themselves from whatever the Benefactor is trying to do to them.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... if they’re trying to protect themselves I shouldn’t try and snap them out of it then.</p>

<p class="dialogue">No, Libuza, I would play along for now, we still need to find Zebulon.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, the history of women’s footwear on Earth is a painful history.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Speaking of that, Libuza, I don’t think Harvard was admitting women this early. They started in the forties but it took a while for them to issue their first PhD to a woman. So whatever we’re looking at, it’s going to be evocative of the forties, but there’s going to be some inaccuracies, looks like.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Allied forces continue to face fierce resistance from German troops across North Africa, as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps pushes eastward through Libya toward Egypt. British and American commanders express grave concern about the potential fall of the vital Suez Canal to Axis control. Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, Soviet forces are locked in bitter urban combat with German armies in Stalingrad, where street-by-street fighting has turned the city into a bloody battleground...</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m feeling okay. This body isn’t mine but I don’t feel too disoriented.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your bio-signs are still in a nominal range. I need to get a sense of your brain function. When you’re talking to me, do you have to speak out loud there as well?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes, it looks like when I speak to you I also have to speak out loud.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Noted. I think that might be better for your brain function to have two tasks overlap. Right now you’re seeing things visually, like a human would?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting. You have an under-developed ocular center— I’m surprised you can see color.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That may explain why you’re getting a grayscale image on your end.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. It’s fascinating, actually. This little stunt of yours is telling me a lot about your brain that I didn’t perviously know.</p>

The last man to make a stand against the Spanish was a man named Rumiñahui (roo-mee-nyah-WEE). He burned Quito to the ground so the Spanish couldn’t claim it and, as the legend goes, he hid the gold of the Incan Empire somewhere in the jungle. When the Spanish finally caught Rumiñahui they tortured him until death. He never gave up the location of the gold.</p>

And even though this message travels at the speed of light it will take, I’m guessing, 2.4 Million years to reach the nearest comms node... so what am I doing?... I’m sending this because it may be the last time I send a message to someone... I’m in a pretty sticky wicket right now. I’ve been wondering lately when my luck was going to run out, and I may have come right up to the edge of it... I needed to send a message to somebody, so I’m sending it to you, Berts.</p>
<p class="dialogue">If somehow you do hear it, it may be kind of a burden to hear. Sorry about that... Couple of things: you should stop investigating Billius. If you don’t, The Teds are going to make you their prisoner. I know you think you can get out of it, but how about you just don’t, okay? Just don’t... There may be one less Leif out there to pull you out of a jam so, could you do me a favor and just skip it?... Oh hey, also, I went about 150 years out from your current situation and you were the chairman of the new Coalition. You beat the Teds in a war. Also you made a home on Sigius for the last Earthlings left in the galaxy... I mean, that was in another universe, but still, it was you and it was really cool. I never did anything that cool... I have a sneaking suspicion that you and Verge have stayed in touch... I’m sure my name’s never come up... If you see them can you tell them I’m sorry... Also if you’ve still got that Julia Roberts costume, could you check in on my mom sometime?... I’d appreciate it... I don’t know how I’m getting out of this one, Berts... Having someone to send this message to has made that a little easier... goodbye...</p>

<p class="dialogue">Here you are, Ms. Higgins.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s whiskey.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Could I just get a glass of water?</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’d advise against drinking the water here.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then why did we even stop here?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">To make the next leg of our journey, we’re going to need a riverboat, and due to the fact that we are currently being chased, I can’t go through the usual channels. I’ve heard there’s a man here with a boat, so we’ve stopped here.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And now that you’ve taken me deep into the jungle are you going to tell me who is trying to kill us?</p>

<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do they want?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">The short answer is: Gold. The long answer is: a series of easily manipulatable autocrats in strategic nations around they world. Elizabeth Anaïs Duchamp is one of the wealthiest women in Europe, and she is the leader of a secret society that attempts to manipulate global events.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If they’re so rich, why do they need the gold?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Money can be traced, gold cannot. Their current project is a particular madman who happens to have an army marching across Europe right now— let’s not mention his name. An army runs on money. They want to make sure he doesn’t run out of it.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seems like a rather complicated plan just to get their hands on some gold.</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">If the legends are true, it’s a sizable amount of gold, Ms. Higgins. Enough to transform a nation.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="direction">WE MOVE BACK TO THE DINER. THE DINER HAS STARTED TRAVELING.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, everyone. We’re on our way... I have no idea what we’re headed toward right now. These mystery men have been trying to kill us for weeks now— and then right when they could have, they didn’t. And now we’re headed to their home world. I don’t know what that means... Let’s take some comfort in the fact that we got almost all of the refugees to safety, and with a little luck, maybe they’ll manage to get out of this goddamn system and find the home they were all looking for... We have twelve hours to prepare. But, prepare for what? We have no idea what awaits us the next time we touch down. If we could get some sense of the Benefactor’s plan, that would be something. But right now we’re flying blind. I hate it, but there’s not much we can do about it.</p>

<p class="direction">WE MOVE BACK TO THE SEEDY CANTINA. NELL APPROACHES THE TABLE AND PUTS DOWN TWO GLASSES.</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">The location we’re looking for is right here. Now, as you can see, this map has no reference points except for this city right here. This is an ancient Incan city. The first explorers from Spain discovered this city. They said it was a thriving city, full of commerce and trade— it was the hub of the entire region. The problem with this discovery is that when the Spanish finally managed to get back there a hundred years later, the city was gone.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It disappeared?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">It did not. Everyone assumed that the early explorers had been mistaken somehow and that the city didn’t really exist. The problem with explorers, is that they aren’t archeologists. These were explorers on a new continent. What did these explorers bring with them?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... supplies?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Libuza... disease.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Diseases?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. The explorers didn’t come to conquer yet— that would come later. But even though they didn’t come to conquer, they brought with them the most effective weapon in their arsenal: Diseases that the Incans had no defense against. The explorers show up with diseases, then they leave. Then a hundred years goes by. What happens in that one hundred years, Ms. Higgins?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... They all die.</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s correct. Over a hundred years, the population is decimated by disease, and the jungle takes back the city. It effectively vanishes.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you know where the city is.</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">In fact, I do.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are the coordinates?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Fucking jackpot!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But what is she saying?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s a hack back.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">When you try to hack someone’s system, you also make yourself vulnerable because your system is connected to theirs now, right? The mystery men showed up with some kind of device that shut down the Mucklewains, but now look. Effie’s on a mission to a place in the jungle called “His Hidden Plan.” This whole adventure isn’t them trying to protect themselves, they’re trying to hack into his systems.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They know how to do that?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Mucklewains don’t “know” how to do anything. Everything they do is expressed symbolically. So while we’re seeing some treasure hunting adventure, what’s really happening is a hack into the Benefactor’s systems. Libuza, I’m almost positive that if you can get to that spot in the jungle, we can somehow know the Benefactor’s plan for us.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That would be amazing.</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">The more information we can have before we land on their home world, the better. Libuza may be onto something downstairs. Do you have anything else?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was talking to Leif and Ava earlier. They had a theory, and I think I have to agree.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Their weapons suck.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Their weapons are incredibly powerful.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not in one to one combat. If it’s an overwhelming force, sure they’re powerful. But they’re slow to fire and they’re vulnerable when they are firing.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The kind of technology these guys have, they could make something way more effective than what they’re using.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">And how do you account for that?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Only theory I have? Their weapons are built for a different kind of target.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">What kind of target?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been thinking about it all day. The only reason I would make a weapon like that— a weapon that doesn’t kill you but instead flings you across the multiverse? I’d only use that on something I didn’t know how to kill.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... They’re scared of something.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Something that isn’t us.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t know... I’d love to not find out.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... that’s not the most helpful information, but any information will do.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kazi?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, Fiona?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You said you needed information. Is there any way that some information might be... inside me?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was already able to get some information from you, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was just thinking... You said I was born in some sort of birthing chamber and then had memories implanted in me. Even though I was young, do you think maybe, there are some memories in there... somewhere?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... The human brain can’t create long term memories until roughly its third year... which means for memories to be implanted in you, you would need a brain capable of retaining long term memories... so... I suppose it’s possible that you may have very faint memories of that process taking place.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... want to come and get them?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know if that’s wise, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You already put nanobites in my bloodstream, couldn’t you just use those?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would need to add more, and it would be very invasive.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s okay.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not okay, Fiona. It would be very dangerous.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... Then what?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Then what?”</p>
<p class="character">SOGGY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once they’re sauced enough, they tell me their plan and how long it’s taken them to put it together. They have it on good authority that the gold is here, they have a map leading to the gold there, etcetera. And after I hear them tell their little tale, that’s when I lay it on them. “Then what?”... It’s at that moment they realize that they’ve been so focused on finding the treasure of a lifetime, they have no idea what they’re going to do once they have it. They think for a long while and then finally come up with something completely embarrassing like “Buy a house.” Why does money always fall into the hands of those incapable of doing anything interesting with it?</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what would you do?</p>
<p class="character">SOGGY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Money corrupts the soul, Doctor. That’s why I’ve seen fit to never have any. Though, if you do hit the jackpot I wouldn’t mind a new boat.</p>
<p class="character">NELL</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll consider it.</p>
<p class="character">SOGGY</p>
<p class="dialogue">But in truth... what will you do with it all?</p>

<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ll be fine, Fiona. She had to do the same thing to me a couple of times. I don’t know what it is about shrapnel, it just loves to get lodged in my brain.</p>

<p class="dialogue">No, the talking helps, I need to look out for slurred speech and jumbled words.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. What’s so special about Teta?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Teta, Libuza, and myself are all the children of a very mysterious man who conquered a large part of the Andromeda galaxy a very long time ago. He had lots and lots of children whom he left with several genetic advantages. We’re the last three.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happened to the others?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Killed mostly. Some disappeared, but we think they’re dead too.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">We became an inconvenient presence for the powers that be. But I was used to being an inconvenient presence, so I knew how to survive. Libuza survived because she could always anticipate their moves, and Teta lived for obvious reasons.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Toward the end, he could see that he couldn’t win against a changing galaxy.</p>

<p class="dialogue">So he climbed into his ship and he flew it into a star.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow... was he a good dad?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">None of us knew him. He had always moved on by the time we were grown.</p>

<p class="dialogue">This is funny. You should do this at parties.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>

<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The pogo stick was invented in 1919 by German inventor Max Pohlig and German engineer Ernst Gottschall (who combined their names Po-Go for the device). However, modern spring-based pogo sticks were developed and popularized in America by George Hansburg in the 1920s. According to legend, Hansburg was inspired by seeing children in Burma using stilts with rubber springs.</p>
