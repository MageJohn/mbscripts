<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE WALK-IN. AFTER A MOMENT, THE DOOR OPENS.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get the fuck away from me!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona... you’re threatening me with a big block of cheese, there.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the only thing in here that resembles a blunt object.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would’ve gone for the sack of potatoes myself, but whatever you think.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are you?! Why am I wearing this puffy jacket?!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re wearing the jacket because it’s cold in here, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop fucking around with me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m speaking as plainly as I can.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What am I doing here?... What are you going to do to me?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not going to do anything to you.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m guessing you didn’t kidnap me because you thought it would be fun.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">In retrospect it was a little fun. We stole Mitt Romney’s campaign bus—that was something I did not know I had on my bucket list.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who is we?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me and my staff.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Staff?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, you’re at a restaurant.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wh-... Why am I at a restaurant?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because that’s where we work.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this... are you going to eat me?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona, what the fuck? No.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was knocked unconscious and thrown into a refrigerator with a bunch of food, what would you think?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Not that.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are... are you going to try and ransom me or something? I’m not the President’s daughter—both of my parents are public school teachers.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, that’s nice, what do they teach?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">History and- Shut up! Tell me what I’m doing here!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We really didn’t have a choice, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you can’t tell me, is that it? Keep the hostage in the dark while you enact some sort of evil plan?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not it.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it, then? What kind of kidnappers are you?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona... It wasn’t a kidnapping. It was a rescue.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone... someone did something to you. We don’t know who it was, but your mind is not your own. We need to figure out why and we need to figure out a way to fix it.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh... okay... this is a cult... I’ve been kidnapped by a cult. Great.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still no.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I promise I’ll swear allegiance to whatever weird god y’all worship okay? Just please don’t make me do any sex stuff.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ, Fiona. You know what? Here.</p>
<p class="direction">GLORIA OPENS THE DOOR TO THE WALK-IN.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can go.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go ahead.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re letting me leave?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, go ahead. Go call the cops on us. Go nuts.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this a trick?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would you tell me if it was a trick?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course I wouldn’t tell you if it was a trick, that’s what makes it a trick... I’m serious, you can go.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh sure, I walk out there and then you all start hunting me for sport right?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona, I really need your entire generation to stop watching films. Go ahead.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stay back, though.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m staying back.</p>
<p class="direction">FIONA WALKS OUT INTO THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Front door’s right there.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t follow me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I won’t.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh god... oh god... oh god...</p>
<p class="direction">FIONA WALKS OUT THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE PARKING LOT. THE DINER IS SURROUNDED ON EVERY SIDE BY A DENSE FOREST.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the roof.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s up, Fiona?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Where am I?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like we are in a forest.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, what do we know?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Same universe. Same time. Still in Cryptessia.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about the planet?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got the drones doing reconnaissance. Nothing but forest for several miles.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is there anyone here?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s inhabited for sure but it’s pretty sparse. There’s the occasional structure but not anything fancy. No radio or microwave frequencies either. Whatever civilization there is, it’s looking pre-industrial.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also, we’re staying put in this system, I can see where we’re going for the next few days. I’ve got the diner’s pre-print up on the next few planets. We’re basically going to be pond skipping around this system for a while, I’m assuming to find the refugees.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I figured... Caspar, what are you reading?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I grabbed a New York Times from 2012 before we left. Fiona, what is “Gangnam Style?”</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Somebody tell me where the fuck I am.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have no idea, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does everyone know my name?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You told me your name.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You... You came into my Starbucks.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were scoping me out, is that it?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wasn’t my idea for you to come along, that was all Queen Bee’s idea.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come along where? Where am I?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just said-</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is your restaurant, you don’t know where your own restaurant is?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes we do.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on, are we calling me Queen Bee, now?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... you said I could go, right?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure. Do you want us to give you directions home?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, please.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona, home is that way.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">About 83 lightyears that way.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re on another planet, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Fucking lunatics.</p>
<p class="direction">FIONA WALKS OFF.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, do we have any idea when their ship is getting here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava started talking into my friggin’ head again a few minutes ago, they just came out of some sort of wormhole and they’re headed here, should be a few minutes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wormhole?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, apparently the whole galaxy has a network of wormholes built into the fabric of space, no warp gates needed.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is going on in this system?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a very good question, Leif. Another good question: does anyone know a seven letter word for “Noncompetitive races?”</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m assuming we’ve landed somewhere near the next batch of refugees. Any idea where they might be?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll keep an eye out.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. Ooh! “Funruns.”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nailed it! (Writing.) Fun... runs.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Hey Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona, you don’t seem to be walking anywhere, I thought you were going home?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I’ve learned a lot about space being out here... What you’re looking at right now is called a planetary ring. You know, like Saturn has?... I always thought it was weird that everything ends up in a ring around a planet, it always seemed way too organized. Like, wouldn’t all the space rocks just be everywhere? Turns out, rings always gather around the equator of a planet because of a “planetary bulge” at the middle. That’s where the gravity is the strongest so all the rocks and ice and debris end up there... People think Earth might have had one for a while. A long time ago, a passing asteroid got shredded by Earth’s gravity and for a few million years there was a ring around it... or at least, my Earth was like that, I don’t know about yours... because, the thing is, Fiona, you’re not from Earth. You’re from a planet that someone spent a lot of time and energy to make look like Earth. I don’t know why... I’m trying to find out...</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... This moment is so cheezy, right? Like how many times have you seen this in a movie? “You’re whole life has been a lie. I’m here to show you the true way. Take the red pill or the blue pill.”... Which one is the pill you’re supposed to take—is it the red one or the blue one?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The red one.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right... Oh, hey. I’m just now realizing that if you had The Matrix on your planet, that means that there are two Keanu Reeves out there. Which is not a bad thing, right? We need more guys like him, the more Keanus the better... silver lining.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t feel my hands.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. You’re probably going into shock right now. It’s fine, it’ll pass.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, here they come, I’ve got landing signals.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um. This isn’t really going to help things, Fiona. But, when the spaceship lands try to hang on to consciousness, okay?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Spaceship?</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A MASSIVE SPACECRAFT LOWERING TO THE GROUND.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, damn, that’s a big boy.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Holy shit.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m assuming that’s the first time you’ve seen a spaceship land?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t see anything.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did something happen?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Whoa.</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, but that would answer a lot of questions.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">I see... you would need to overlook ships like this if they were coming to your planet for maintenance.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And ignore alien races so you wouldn’t see the refugees.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Precisely. But they didn’t account for her being on another planet, so she can’t edit that out.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening to me? Is Gloria right? Have I been brainwashed?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Brainwashing is an Earthling myth, Fiona. However you have had extensive work done on your neural environment. Most likely at a very young age.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fantastic.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We think the diner is taking us to all the places they’re holding more of your people, which means there’s more of them around here somewhere.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, any idea where they might be?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a structure about three miles through the forest. I think it’s an old farm or something. That’s probably our best bet.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, you go with Teta to check out the farm, okay?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, let me pack some shit and I’ll be ready to go.</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, maybe not instantly comforting, but stick with it.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no way I’m taking that thing.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, you kind of have to, Fiona. How else are they going to get around?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How else is who going to get around?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Forgive us, Fiona. I’m Zebulon Mucklewain here with my wife, Effie.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, Fiona. May I just say I am impressed that your head hadn’t just spun right off your body.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve got a stiff spine on you there, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are standing there on another world, entirely surrounded by all sorts of strangers and strange things, but look at you there, still walking and talking.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I guess I am doing pretty good, considering.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, there you go, Fiona. Give yourself some credit.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look at that. Fast friends already. Now I’m just going to hand them over to you.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where do I take them?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wherever they need to go.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are you going?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need to go check out a farm down the road, there may be some people there who need help.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do hope you’ll take care of yourself out there young man.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be fine.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, we’re going to need a bit more than “I’ll be fine.” I’m going to need some words from you that will assure me you can be responsible out there and not get yourself stuck in some sort of a thicket.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">A thicket?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I promise I’ll be careful.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we will hold you to your word.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have boots perfectly designed for kicking people right in their rear end, David. Don’t make me put them on.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good God, would you take them, please.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona, let’s go ahead and follow Gloria back inside.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>

<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I really need a normal thing to happen soon.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“The radio is talking to me.” I know, that’s what they all say. Ready for it to get even weirder?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, you may want to take the radio from her.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I sampled her DNA I put nanobots in her blood.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">She has artificial blocks in her brain, with all of this new stimulus hitting against those blocks she was in danger of having a massive hemorrhage. The nanobots will need to remove them. When she wakes up she’ll be out of danger.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But her brain will be completely changed.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, it will literally be a rude awakening.</p>

You’re attacking yourself because, after a series of massive successes, suddenly you were wrong. How were you supposed to know? It was working.

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, seriously. You watch that movie and you’re like “Look at this guy. He’s got a gun and whip and a fedora and tenure, he’s a hero.” But then you keep watching the movie and you see him literally fail at everything he tries to do throughout the entire movie. He succeeds at nothing he attempts in the movie. That’s why he’s the hero. Because he keeps going.</p>

<p class="dialogue">There are two types of Nyxites. Flaxian and Crimson. I’m a Flaxian. When Flaxians speak, our voice vibrates on multiple frequencies at once, most of which you can’t hear. Those frequencies bounce around and I pick up all their echoes with a gland in my forehead right here. I couldn’t really see you when we met, I just received data in the shape of you.

<p class="dialogue">Another thing about Flaxians—it’s a good thing, when you get into a new room, to make a little noise and have a look around. So all of us have a short phrase that we say in a new place. It’s different for everyone, like a little mantra. That was mine: “Here I am.”</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Leif fixed the door so now we can come and go as we please. It’s a little cold, but I figured this would be better than being crammed into the dining room.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Are... are you covered in fur now?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes. My body adapts to cold weather.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Is everybody like this on your planet?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">No two people are the same on my home world. Because of the harsh conditions we have to constantly make upgrades to our bodies. Once you have the necessary changes done, most of us decide to keep going. I may have gone a bit farther than most people on my planet.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It sounds painful.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is. But it’s very empowering... I’m saddened to hear about Maloo. She was a very hard worker. When we track down her siblings we’ll make sure they’re taken care of.</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looking like it’s pre-industrial. There weren’t any traces of technology but there’s scattered houses and basic structures. Somebody lives here but I wouldn’t expect any technology past swords and arrows.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Wait, do you two know each other?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. Worked for the most notorious pirate in the Triad.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They all know about the pirate stuff.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Shoot.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you really eat a dude’s skull?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Just the one time.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did you eat his skull?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I said to him “I’m going to kill you and eat your skull.” You can’t say that and then NOT eat the guy’s skull. It’s bad for business.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay but... how did you eat his skull?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Barbecue sauce.</p>

<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">An intervention?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Having something to do with that head of yours, Fiona. There were all sorts of things not right up there.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A serial number... Why is it there?</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is Cryptessia. Before they abandoned this ship, our enemies tried to purge their stored memory. But Teta managed to reconstruct some of it. This is a rudimentary map of Cryptessia.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those red dots seem to be all of the planets under their control. There’s about a thousand of them. All Class M planets, so humans can live there.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a lot of territory but it’s nothing compared to the Teds. You were saying they were worse than the Teds.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What is it, then?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Every planet in this system has it’s own designation.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The planet you were on yesterday, where you picked up Fiona, appears to be this one: Planet 2012. The planet we’re currently on appears to be this one: apparently it’s called The Malthusian Trap. Other planets have different names. They’re a bit poetic: The Four Years War, The Great Mortality, Ten Kingdoms.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">These are all names from Earth history.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought they might be. What do they mean?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh, I’m sorry, do you require someone who’s an expert in Earth history right now?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How dare you?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Four Years War is another name for World War I. The Great Mortality is another name for the Black Plague. Ten Kingdoms could be a reference to a period in China where there was a lot of political chaos.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are they all named after Earth history?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">All of them.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not just on the planets. Inside those suits the mystery men are wearing? All Earthlings.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The bad guys are Earthlings too? It’s an entire galaxy of Earthlings?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe so, yes. If Teta, Leif, and David encounter any natives of this planet, they’ll likely be Earthlings as well.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How the hell did they get here?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like I said, they were grown here. I imagine on each of these planets is a massive facility where Earthling-like hominids are grown and processed.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ, are they eating them?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not processed for food. I wasn’t quite understanding until you told me about Maloo, and Ava told me about The Benefactor.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who the hell is The Benefactor?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s the leader. Zoom in on this corner of the map... There it is. We all remember this, right?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The egg.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. In this galaxy there’s one solar system that seems to be encased in some sort of obscuring field that makes it look like an egg. That’s where they control all of this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Control all of what?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, all of these historical terms, they refer to wars, plagues, political upheaval?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what about the one we’re on now? The Malthusian Trap?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thomas Malthus was a British economist. He talked about a period in history where increased food production led to population growth, the population growth then led to famine and starvation, and then everything repeated again. Because of that, civilization was trapped in a feedback loop for literal centuries.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what pulled you out of it?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Technology. The industrial revolution, apparently.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">The records we have aren’t complete for this planet, but it does indicate that the ecosystems have an engineered bacteria.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it dangerous?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It eats plastics.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Plastics?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It would prevent anyone on this planet from developing complicated technology.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You said it was technology that pulled your civilization out of this Malthusian Trap. This planet has a biological stopgap that would prevent that from happening.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So they stay stuck in the past forever.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what you’ll see on all of these planets. War, famine, plague, chaos. All of it engineered to lock people into a constant state.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, but, 2012?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, that’s an odd one. Perhaps we should ask Fiona. Hello, Fiona.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Tell me about my planet.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Luckily for us there was a bit more information embedded in your DNA that told us about your planet, Fiona. Planet 2012. Let me make sure I have this right. “Employs a system wherein people may login to a network where they would either express dread of a thing that was coming or weigh in on something that’s already happened, eliminating the present moment. People often remarked that they felt as though they were in a ‘forever decade’, where nothing ever seemed to change.” Does that sound accurate, Fiona?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So all of these planets are like intentional communities, all controlled from a central location?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And if done correctly you’d have people like Fiona, who’s been living the same year, over and over again, since the day she was born. Isn’t that right, Fiona?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can see it now. Yes.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s your head?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It really hurts.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would this benefactor want people to be at war forever?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Or starving forever. Is he a just a psychopath or something?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s trying to save the universe.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like that’s not the way to do it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean he’s trying to save the universe from ending.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">By doing all this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apparently, his entire philosophy is that a universe is shaped by the sentient minds in it. It’s nonsense, but that’s what he believes. He seems to think that if he gets everyone locked into some sort of intractable situation, they’ll stop looking forward into the future and become... recursive. If you imagine every universe as an arrow going from beginning to end, he wants to make that into a circle that constantly recycles itself.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That explains why he hates the diner so much.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is every planet different? Why is one planet 2012 and the other planet a global war or something?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid I have the answer to that one. Not from wisdom but from growing up on a hog farm. When you want to know what feed is making the hogs sick, you divide them into four groups and feed them each something different.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s looking for the best way to achieve his goal.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe so my friend.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">This entire galaxy is his laboratory.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, there’s one question hovering over all of this: why Earth? Why us? This guy engineered a thousand Earths and, I’m guessing, trillions of Earthlings. Why? What’s the big deal about us?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid there’s a question that hovers over even that, Caspar. You said it yourself. A thousand Earths, trillions of Earthlings. If he truly orchestrated all of this, it would’ve taken thousands of your years to do so.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The work of creating all of these Earths and these Earthlings would’ve had to start before Earthlings even existed on Earth. This isn’t a despot, or an evil emperor, or a mad king...</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, it’s no problem. Clementine was a god kind of.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine was also a dummy.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bless her heart.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also, I know three of these guys just very nearly killed all of us, but the two that Ava talked to were total idiots.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are some theories about that.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I have thoughts. Y’all, there’s simply no way in heck that these ne’er do wells thought that parading those two corn fritters in front of Ava was the best way to go about things. I met the two of them and they were as a dumb as a box of hair.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid those two gents were meant to be a couple of balls of twine for Ava to bat back and forth.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This Benefactor guy was watching you the whole time?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a little too easy to fuck with their heads. It looks like they sent their worst and dumbest on purpose.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s more, I don’t think there’s any way this new malevolence didn’t know that Kazi was whispering in Caspar’s ear this whole time.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He knew you were sending me a message?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">We believe so. We believe he was trying to bait the diner into showing up nearby.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So he could blast us out of the sky.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But in both situations you were more than he bargained for. He wasn’t expecting you to escape Earth.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got a pretty big info dump for you when you get back, but here’s the thing with this planet: There’s some sort of bacteria here that eats plastic.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, is that going to screw up any of your whizbangs or thingamajigs?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Getting back to the topic of you being a terrible person who did terrible things.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Is that why you do all this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>

<p class="dialogue">You could just build a ship and go wherever you want. Instead you do this. Are you trying to make up for all that stuff you did as a pirate?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d be a pretty big idiot if I thought there was someone out there keeping score, David. The universe doesn’t care how good you are to your fellow man. If there was a way to take it all back, maybe I’d give it a try, but that particular innovation is a technology that’s beyond even me... I don’t think it’ll change anything, but it has been nice after all that to defend something beautiful. I don’t know what the diner is, but it is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Not a bad way to play out the rest of your hand. Of course you’ll always have people like Teta reminding you what a shithead you were, but that’s to be expected.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I get it. I was still doing mercenary shit on Alexa Prime when I got a weird message from someone named Libuza, telling me that she was my sister. Next thing I know, I was making the insane choice of fighting a guerrilla war against the Teds. Shit can really change on a dime sometimes.

<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bad math smell?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then why are there gaps in what I can see?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You gathered data on all the matter in this universe, and you’ve been saying to yourself, “where did I go wrong?” But I think you’re asking the wrong question.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, couldn’t the reason she can’t see the mystery men is because they’re from another universe. She can predict everything in this universe but what if they’re not from this universe.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The diner isn’t from this universe either and she could see that.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not a bad question, Caspar. I was able to see the diner the same way that I’m able to see the two of you right now. I sense the sounds bouncing off of you so I know you’re there. Intrusions from other universes still show up in my data as a very obvious blank spot surrounded by causation.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like throwing a sack of flour on the invisible man. You still don’t see the invisible man, but you see the flour that covers him.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see. Amazing that I’m still in this conversation right now.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have an idea, but it’s pretty nutty.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oooh, and I’m just about to tap out, I can feel it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your dataset is the condensed matter of the universe microseconds before expansion.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effectively, the beginning of the universe.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But it’s only effectively the beginning of the universe. There were those brief moments before the big bang, before the Higgs field changed. Fractions of microseconds before everything came into being.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no data on those moments, there’s no data to be gathered.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure... buuuut if time and gravity and all the heavy hitters of the cosmos weren’t constant laws, but aspects that evolved and came into being as the universe expanded, then what are those fractions of microseconds before everything? Can you measure them?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re saying that the reason I can’t see The Benefactor, is because he comes from that period before the universe decided to have things like time?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does he say he’s striving for? Balance in the universe. A universe that isn’t a straight line but a circle. Pure existence. In those microseconds before the big bang, if there was nothing like time or even space, it would’ve been pure existence.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s not trying to transform the universe, he’s trying to bring it back to what it was.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If that’s what we’re dealing with—if he’s a being who existed before even matter existed—how bound by the laws of physics would he be? How invisible would that make him to the Vistek?</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t have any perturbations.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Forgive us, Gloria, but a cleaning of the grill has come to hold a double meaning within these environs.</p>
<p class="direction">SHE STOPS CLEANING.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I can’t believe this but, I have a question about the bible.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, let me just get comfortable.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We both have our listening hats on, Gloria, you go right ahead.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wasn’t there a point in the bible when Jesus told some lepers to heal themselves?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Shit, really?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid not.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a common mistake Gloria. At one point, Jesus told the lepers how to continue to heal themselves and people had a tendency to hold on a bit too hard to that point.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, it tends to be used in times when folks would like to not feel overburdened by the miseries of others.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But, sure enough, Jesus walked himself in there and said, whiz-bang, you’re healed.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just like that.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a bit infuriating, if I’m honest.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Makes it look so easy.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bit of a show off at times, our savior.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I guess I don’t have a question about the bible.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, why are you asking about lepers?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How many people did we leave behind on Fiona’s planet yesterday?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Nikki Minaj at least.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A lot.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I just... Keep going?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were lucky to get out of there alive, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They weren’t. They’re all going to die there.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t tell me you’re trying to make it your responsibility to save an entire galaxy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whose responsibility should it be? They won’t be able to do it themselves.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Think of the amount of people that you’re talking about. Going up against The Teds was insane enough. Not to mention we’ve got about a hundred more refugees to find.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And after that we just leave behind an entire galaxy full of enslaved people?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. That’s exactly what we do, Gloria. Because we’re a hand full of people and they are a space god and his army.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s certainly a maze to be in, Gloria. How does one go from one place to another, bypassing the sick and the needy? There is something within us that screams out to help our fellow beings, yet with so much sorrow in the world, one could work their whole life to save others and find at the end they’ve barely moved that stone up the hill.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It causes one to wonder if they should even begin. How can you feel complete in your task if the world is still filled with such sorrow, even after an eternity trying to heal it?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But it should be remembered that the Lord has put no one person on the Earth to heal all of its ills. We are all here together, and our burdens should be shouldered together.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What we’re saying is, there’s no shame in scooping up these refugees and then performing a healthy skee-dattle out of this particular corner of the sky.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">See there? Jesus approves of us not having to save literally everyone in the galaxy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Kazi told me she had to leave people behind in The Triad. She said that it haunts her. I don’t want to feel that way.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, step outside of yourself for a moment. What would your advice be to yourself?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine it’d be to fixate upon the thing right in front of you. Sometimes the big picture is overwhelming in its enormity.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can’t say that I’m great about following my own advice, y’all.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh... Hi.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Getting dark out, Fiona. Where you headed?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh...</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s alright.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Inside they were talking about “jumping” and “traveling” and how it was going to “happen soon” and it all sounded pretty scary and suddenly I was headed for the door and there was this part of me that thought I should make a run for it and take my chances in the woods.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we certainly can’t blame you, Fiona. Folks will do a lot just to feel some solid ground beneath their feet.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we’re just sittin’ here, Fiona. There’s nothing we can do to put a stop to you heading off into those woods.</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just don’t know if I can do this.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona, earlier today you heard our friend Caspar, going on and on about history. Remember that?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure what it is with him and history. I imagine he takes a shine to it because you always know where history is. It’s right there in the past.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fiona, you know what no historian has ever said in one of those books of theirs?</p>
<p class="character">FIONA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Luckily, they were alone.”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s very true, Fiona. In the great stretch of time that begins with those quiet hours of the lord hovering over the waters, all the way up to you standing there, at the edge of that parking lot, being alone has never been a welcome feeling, never a boon.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So while the solid ground of those lonely woods may seem like a comfort, do yourself a service and make yourself a home amongst people, won’t you?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Everyone, we’re going to jump soon. At our next stop there are going to be even more refugees to save. And if there are just a few of them each time, we’re going to be making a lot of stops. The planets will often be hostile, and we’re going to be hunted by the mystery men the whole time. But we have the sisters with us, we have a ship, and we have each other. Shit, we even have a barista now. It’s going to be hard, but we can do it.</p>
