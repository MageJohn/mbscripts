<p class="direction">IN THE SILENCE WE HEAR A VOICE.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once upon a time there were three sisters: A healer, a warrior, and a seer. Their father had died, his enemies all around.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The seer looked, and she saw a great city. A city that shined. Whose light could be seen by anyone who looked. A city that had not been built. They would build it themselves.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the fertile ground on which the city would grow, was in a land too far away...</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then the seer saw a man. The man would travel in an impossible ship. A ship that could go anywhere, but could not be steered.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the seer could see where the ship would go next. The three sisters boarded the ship and traveled a long way. And just as the seer foretold, it brought them to the far off land where they would build the city in her visions.</p>
<p class="dialogue">They left the man and his impossible ship and began their work...</p>
<p class="dialogue">But there was something that the seer could not see...</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a dark place. A place where light dies.</p>
<p class="dialogue">She could not see this place. But it could see her.</p>
<p class="dialogue">A dark army issued forth from this place, and sought to undo the great work of the three sisters. Constantly under attack, the seer had another vision.</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That the strange man in the impossible ship must return...</p>
<p class="dialogue">... This is the story I was told...</p>
<p class="direction">A TEA KETTLE’S WHISTLE FADES IN. THE KETTLE IS REMOVED FROM THE BURNER. WE ARE IN THE MUCKLEWAIN’S FARMHOUSE. IT IS LATE AT NIGHT AND EFFIE IS MAKING TEA.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Another sleepless night?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I appreciate you having a sleepless night right along with me, dear, but there’s no need.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">One of the pitfalls of sharing a life. You share in the joy but also share in, well, night’s such as this... you’ve been having bad feelings again?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing new about that, I’ve had them before... It’s different this time.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">How so?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">My visions in the past have been like looking at something from far off. Like it’s on the other side of the field and I can just make it out. Like seeing a deer move out of the woods.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And how does it feel this time?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Like it’s looking back at me.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Perhaps we should fire up the radio? Check in on our friends, make sure everything’s right in the world.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re all asleep, as we should be.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just to check.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I suppose it couldn’t hurt, make yourself some tea.</p>
<p class="direction">EFFIE CROSSES TO THE RADIO AND FIRES IT UP. WE HEAR THE WHINE OF TRANSISTORS AND THE BUZZ OF ELECTRICITY.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there, y’all. Anybody up at this ungodly hour? Caspar? Ava?... Gloria? Leif?... Nothing.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Worth a try.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is ridiculous, what am I even doing?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing wrong with checking in.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I feel as though all that time we spent chasing around Clementine nearly ended us.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That it did, but as is always the case, it has made us stronger.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just a bit jumpy, is all.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How about some pancakes?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pancakes?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, it’s two in the morning.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you turning my sleeplessness into an excuse to eat pancakes?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I may be.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are these pancakes of yours going to fix my sleeplessness?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">They may. And if they do not, at least we’ve had some pancakes.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your point is well heard. Go on, off to the kitchen with you.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Off I go.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the kitchen.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was reading the other day that the ancient Egyptians used lettuce juice to aid them in sleep.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, they used what?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the kitchen.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lettuce juice.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon, if you come out into this living room with the juice of a head of lettuce-</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the kitchen.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I know better than to do that, dear... how does one even juice a head of lettuce?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s leave that as a mystery of the ancient world, shall we?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the kitchen.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Agreed.</p>
<p class="direction">EFFIE FIRES UP THE RADIO AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar?... Ava?... What am I doing?</p>
<p class="direction">SHE SHUTS OFF THE RADIO AGAIN. AFTER A MOMENT, WE HEAR A SOUND FAR OFF. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE SHAKES.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I felt it as well... Perhaps a storm?</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s up?... Well where do you think I am, I’m on the bus. My third bus, which is ridiculous... Yeah I’ve heard of cars, I hear they’re popular... He is? What is he selling?... Uh huh... You know what the problem is? People assume I don’t have a car in Los Angeles County because I can’t afford one. Because of that large assumption do you know how many people I have coming to me like “My cousin is selling his car, my grandmother died and we’re getting rid of her car, have you heard of this new website that gives you a car whenever you need it?” I get this non-stop... Uh huh... Yes... Yes, it’s true, I am sitting here on my third bus in the last hour, heading into Pasadena and that is the choice I have made... Because-... Would you listen to me damn it?... Nobody gets to tell me to own a car if I don’t want to. My feet, my brain, my wallet, my phone, my headphones. Every day, me versus Los Angeles, armed with all that, okay?... This is not me being anything, this is me saying no. People should say that more often. I am the Pope of the Church of Nope... Well, I’m surprised you asked because you’ve heard this from me about eighty-six times... It’s been going fine... Yeah, we have breakfast on Saturday, I make fun of him, we argue, I go home, we do it again next week... We argue about whatever... I never need to talk afterward, that’s probably why I keep doing it... Uh huh... well I’d love to but I’m busy planning the party that I throw at the end of the year. Yeah, see I have a lot of money saved at the end of the year because I don’t have a car. I’d offer you an invitation but it’s only accessible by bus. Uh huh... This is my stop I’ve gotta go.</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell did I just see outside?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a robot with “delicious food”.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah, I’ve been seeing those. They deliver food, they can get into elevators and everything.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have opinions.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s unlike you.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">So the cost of having some kid walk a delivery up to the the ninth floor of a bank was just too much? Somebody had to innovate that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, businesses don’t start in America because someone has a good idea, they start because it’s an idea that enough rich people can be hornswoggled into investing in.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that word you just used with me?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hornswoggled?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You feel comfortable using that world in this modern age?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a perfectly acceptable word.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a perfectly acceptable word for a Kentucky senator in 1836.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A lot of people like cars.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like cars.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A lot of people like them, where would people be without a back seat to throw garbage into?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">...What do you drive?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me? Why would I drive when I have robots to deliver food to me every day?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m serious.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So am I. I spend most of my time here and I live, y’know, in the area.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I did not see you as someone who would wind up in the food service industry.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s almost like it chose me.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Customer service does not seem like a strong suit of yours.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about? I spent years honing my customer service skills at a venerated establishment known as the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not customer service, that’s triage.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re oh so similar, though.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... So this is really it, huh? You own a restaurant in Pasadena, this is your life?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m part owner of a restaurant, but yes, this is my life.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you really think a greasy spoon like this is going to survive in one of the richest towns in California.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ouch.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry. I always thought mom was the one keeping you civilized.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s a little bit true. I guess it’s funny, where people end up. Look at you, every Saturday you take three busses across Los Angeles just to go argue with yours estranged father.</p>

<p class="dialogue">A lot.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s very popular with Quakers.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah, but do you ever feel like they know something that you don’t?</p>

<p class="dialogue">No.</p>

<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And then suddenly I wasn’t, so I figured I should switch to oatmeal.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re a deeply strange person.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do you talk like that about the Quakers? They’re a society of friends.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So how is the, uh, the graffiti business?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, for the third time it’s not graffiti and for the third time, it’s not a business.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is the street art going?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s good, I’ve got a new piece up.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s an old radio next to the cash register, I’m assuming there’s a story.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh... It uh... stopped working about eight months ago, but we have a sentimental attachment to it.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">How old is it?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">1925, I think.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That last one’s a little wordy.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But appropriate.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where did we leave off?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve abandoned the “Who did this to us?” Issue, right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Insufficient data.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we’ve abandoned the “Malevolent Force vs Natural Phenomena” issue?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also insufficient data.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we’ve arrived at “Why here? Why now?”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">To sum up: We have been stranded here for 8 months on an Earth that bears a striking resemblance to our own.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Confirmed.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We all had counterparts on this Earth. We have now confirmed that they have all vanished without a trace.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Presumably taking off on a diner of their own.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">With the exception of this Earth’s Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who has been gone since 1994, just like I was.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You, me, and Gloria have all declined to interact with anyone we may know on this planet. Caspar agreed to be our test case, by logging into his Facebook page, wherein there was a message from his son.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">After making fun of him for having a Facebook page, we arrived here.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Why here, why now?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The chances of us being stranded in this particular spot randomly are non-zero but very remote.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But here we are. Pasadena, California, 2025.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A place that several of us have some kind of connection to.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I used to work here. You visited here for a job interview, Caspar’s son is nearby in Los Angeles, no connections that we know of for Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re here for some sort of reason. But whatever it is, it’s not business as usual.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Because we are grounded.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the Mucklewains.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Mucklewains have gone dark since we’ve been here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we’re back to the message again.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once again we are back at the message. Right before we were hit by this mysterious force, Caspar was hearing a voice in his head. The voice was just saying numbers. We’ve looked at these numbers, and they don’t mean anything.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The message could’ve been incomplete.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. At this point we’re assuming that it is. Which means that we’re waiting for more data.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that brings me back around to it being a malevolent force that attacked us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why again?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar starts getting a message and then we’re attacked.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But look around. This isn’t an attack. If you wanted to attack us, if you wanted to strand us somewhere, where would it be?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bootes Void?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly. Bootes Void is what? Sixty megaparsecs of nothing? If you wanted to get rid of someone and you could put them anywhere, you’d put them there. Not Pasadena, California.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d prefer Boote’s Void, frankly.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s 330 million light years across, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">At least I’d know why I was there.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You need to get over your Earth hatred. We don’t know how long we’re going to be here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m fine. There’s only one of us that I’m actually worried about.</p>

<p class="dialogue">The Fine-Tuned Universe, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Back at the beginning of the 20th century, this guy Lawrence Henderson wrote a book. And in this book he said “Hey, isn’t it weird that Earth seems so perfectly suited for life?” Which was a very smart thing to say, especially for a chemist. Then, a few years later some physicists started saying “Hey, it’s not just Earth, the whole freaking universe seems to be set up in a way that’s perfect for things like Earth to happen.”</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">If that’s true, how come so many things in the universe can kill me?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s a facile argument, David. How come so many things can’t? You are, my friend, a big pile of atoms.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that physics trash talk?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, David. You literally are. You’re a big pile of atoms and inside those atoms are protons and neutrons. Those protons and neutrons don’t really give a shit about each other, they don’t like hanging out but they’re bound together. They’re bound together by something called the strong nuclear force. A mysterious force that holds atoms together. If this force were just a little bit stronger? The universe would have no hydrogen, and if the universe has no hydrogen, then none of this happens.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">None of what happens?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anything... so... why?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m helping out Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That can’t be good for business.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what it’s like running a small business, Kiddo, sometimes it’s all hands on deck.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this because she’s homesick?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">They say Gloria’s depressed.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh they do, do they?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we’re just sharing Gloria’s private business now? Is that what we’re doing?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Relax.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re just concerned about their friend.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh are they? If that’s the case then why am I the only one actually helping the friend they are concerned about?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re big picture people, Caspar. We’re focused on the big picture.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How come this big picture of yours always involves you two sitting here and me actually doing something?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, not interested in whatever this is about, I’m going to go talk to Gloria.</p>
<p class="direction">DAVID EXITS TO THE KITCHEN.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m trying to maintain a relationship with him while also trying to not tell him anything, it’s a very delicate balance.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just told him she was homesick.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Homesick for where? The icy planet that used to be in our deep freeze?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course not.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but now he’s going to talk to Gloria about what’s going on.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I know you two think that anyone without an advanced degree is a fucking idiot, but you have no idea the strength of that kid’s bullshit detector. I haven’t been able to bullshit with him since he was three years old.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s he going to find out? It’s not like we have ghosts in the radio anymore. There’s no wolves in the deep freeze. It’s just a fucking diner now.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">In what world do a rogue theoretical physicist, a space pirate, a taquera, and a DMV worker all hang out?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, but the punchline to that joke is hilarious.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He thinks it’s weird, which I can’t blame him for, and now because he thinks it’s weird he’s going to keep digging and digging until he finds out the truth. You don’t have any idea who you’re dealing with.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You haven’t seen him for years, Caspar, maybe you don’t know him either.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, fuck you, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just saying, he’s probably grown up a little, don’t you think?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. That just means he’s gotten better at it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I say again, what’s he going to dig up? There’s nothing here for him to find anymore.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I hate to bring up an awkward subject, but it might stay that way. Okay? Our ride on the dimensional party bus may have inexplicably come to an end and we may never know why.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which means we all have to do the unthinkable: think about tomorrow.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry to bring up a sore subject.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not a sore subject but it’s a subject that’s different for all of us.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You like it here. We’ve all been talking about how this is a crisis but you like it here. You found your son, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s not my son.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that’s not how you’re acting. You like it here, and I hate it here. Not to bring up a sore subject.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you saying?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m saying I left this planet years ago. For a lot of reasons. I’m stuck here and I don’t like being stuck here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you saying?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want me to think about tomorrow? You want me to think about this in the long term? Long term for me is not settling in to the sunny mountains of Pasadena, California. Long term for me is making a few calls and hitching a ride off this shithole.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well you can fuck off to the Crab Nebula then, Buck Rogers-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, you go ahead. I’m sorry things are a little difficult for you around here so you can do what you always do when things get a little difficult. Leave. Again.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. Both of you stop it. You’re both being assholes and that’s my job.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got tables.</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR WALKS AWAY.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Leif are you being serious?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need to make us some new cash cards. I’ll be on the roof.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE KITCHEN. GLORIA IS COOKING AT THE GRILL.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long have you been doing this?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? Cooking?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you always worked in a restaurant?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pretty much. My first job was a Jack in the Box, I guess that’s a restaurant.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a restaurant. I like their tacos.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... David, I have several sharp objects in this kitchen and you’re going to tell me that you like the Jack in the Box tacos?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hate to be like that but... one in the morning? Two tacos for two dollars?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s not go around calling things tacos just because they’re shaped like tacos okay?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did working at Jack in the Box make you want to commit your life to making food?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Revenge, David. Every plate of food I make is a fuck you to my years at Jack in the Box.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Years?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. Then they offered me a manager position and I was just... they made the offer and I had a terrifying vision of what my life was going to be. So I quit and I started working in kitchens. I didn’t really know what I was doing at first but I did have that one essential skill that every food service worker needs.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Knife skills?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I spoke Spanish. What about you? What do you do again?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m a street artist, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but what do you do in the day time?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I work at the city archives.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What goes on there?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Old records. All kinds of shit going back to the 1800s. It’s boring as hell.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds kind of interesting, it sounds like there’s a lot of history there.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, there is, for sure, but nobody wants to see that. They usually need records for a piece of real estate or whatever. So I sit there all day and get records for people when they come in.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And at night you deface public property.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you like your co-workers?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I deface public property?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re alright. How do you like your co-workers?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">My co-workers are infinitely fascinating. They’re also pretty great. We’ve been through a lot together.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m still trying to figure out how you all came to own a restaurant together. A physicist, an engineer, you, and then the old man.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird, right? Um... it just kind of happened.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did it just kind of happen?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... there was a storm.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">A storm?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was a storm one time and we all took shelter here at this place.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">A storm.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. We got to know each other, stayed in touch and eventually we got the wild idea to go into business together.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">A storm.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">In Pasadena, California.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Known for its torrential downpours.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, it sounds strange, but stranger things have happened.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you’re from Arizona.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What were you doing up here?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Hm?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What were you doing up here?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, Uh, I love oranges.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">There hasn’t been an orange grove in Pasadena for about a hundred years.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you can imagine my disappointment.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um-hm.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, look, that’s life. You kind of get thrown together with people and sometimes you’re not sure how.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is weird though, you’re not wrong. They all have some kind of connection to this place. Ava used to work here, Leif almost worked here, Caspar found you here. Not so much for me, though, I don’t have a connection to here at all.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe you do and you just don’t know it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah sure, maybe.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what?</p>
<p class="direction">DAVID TEARS A DINER TICKET OUT OF A TICKET BOOK.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can check for you. Write down your name, date of birth, mom’s name her date of birth, whatever you can think of. I’ll go look it up at the city archives.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I doubt you’re going to find anything, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just for fun, you never know.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s really okay.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, come on, you’d be doing me a favor, I’m sitting there all day finding old land maps for real estate developers. Help me out.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... okay. Give me the pen.</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR SITS DOWN AT AVA’S BOOTH.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I thought you had tables.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m taking a break.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You should apologize to Leif.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif should apologize to me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Both are true, how about you kick it off?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we talk about something else please?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, literally anything else?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Literally anything?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="direction">AVA PUTS A DIFFERENT NOTEBOOK IN FRONT OF HER.</p>
<p class="character">AVA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s talk about your brain.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">My brain?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’m sure there are no insults for me hiding in this conversation.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, they’re hiding in every conversation, Schmoopie.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine, what about my brain?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When we’re at the diner, at least when it worked, time didn’t pass for us. I kept calling it null entropy. But I’m curious how our brains work in that environment. If time doesn’t pass, how are we creating new memories?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Isn’t this more of a neurology question, that’s not your field.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do what I want. We’ve established now that you were here for over a hundred years before Leif showed up.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apparently.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Apparently. You say apparently because Ex told you how old you were and you didn’t know it. You don’t remember those years. It wasn’t until Leif showed up that you began to remember things because having someone there caused your memory to work differently, right?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess, sure. But I remember some things.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... for example, I remember that one time John Updike walked in the door.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">John Updike.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Classic American writer John Updike came into the diner.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, and he was an asshole.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I distinctly remember saying “You’re an asshole, John Updike.”</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you remember that and not the other hundred or so years.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I had the John Updike memory because a couple of years ago someone came into the diner and they were reading Rabbit Run. Rabbit Run by John Updike, and then I had the memory.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So things can sort of jog your memory?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apparently. Wait. Do you have an entire notebook devoted to my brain?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I read it please?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure, go ahead.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It’s written in that fucked up shorthand you write in, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. But go ahead and read it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like right now, what are you writing right now?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m writing words that you are welcome to read.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I can’t read those words.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well if you’re not willing to do the work, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, leaving now.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Of course I recognize you... You.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Back soon?</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I’m not snooping, I promise. I processed your leave of absence paperwork.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leave of absence.</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">From... where?</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh God. I know what you mean. I was on maternity leave a couple of years ago, when I got back I did NOT know what I was doing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh... What is happening?</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re set to come back in a month, I think, right? I’ve got a list on my desk of everyone on leave. The JPL Missing in Action list we call it. It’s a joke, we know you’re not missing. You’re number three on the list, there’s Dr. Glass from astrodynamics, Brad Menear from military acquisitions, and then you from special projects.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course you do. Of course that’s where I work... I work at Jet Propulsion Laboratory... still.</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are such a kook, I swear. I think you said something about going to New Brunswick.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How was it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Eventful.</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have to say, you don’t look too happy to be coming back, do you need an extension? People do it all the time, just give us a call and I can tack on an extra month for you. Do you need an extension?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, well, just shoot us an email if you do.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no.</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes! And I think we’ve got it figured out so we won’t get busted by security this time.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re in the HR department?</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You should totally come, people have been asking about you, they miss your sense of humor.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I miss it too.</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway, GREAT to see you. Maybe I’ll se you tonight?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well space and time are infinite so there’s a non-zero chance of everything.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You’ve heard that, have you?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">And while everyone in this joint likes to say all I do at night is deface public property, I will continue to insist that I am an artist. My canvas is the city, and through my canvas I am a purveyor of joy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The family resemblance is rearing its ugly head, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It all started for me a few years ago. On the street I found packet of name tags. They said “hello my name is” and left a blank space. Out of boredom I started writing all kinds of random shit in that blank space: “Smelga Snoronowitz,” “Sherbet Aggressive,” “FeedMahFish.” Just nonsense. And then I’d peel away the back and stick them to lamp posts, crosswalks, whatever. It was a small thing in a big world, but I liked it. They became little acknowledgments of my existence. I discovered something. See here’s what it is to be an artist, Gloria: You take the world in. You filter it through your mind. You live in it. And you become an artist when you respond. When you talk back to the world you live in. And once I started I couldn’t stop. And once I couldn’t stop, everything got bigger and bigger. Stickers lead to wheat paste, wheat paste led to stencils, you know what I mean?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was looking to up my game. Get a bigger canvas. Make a statement. And then, last week, it all came together, when I looked across the street from your restaurant and saw an abandoned billboard above the street.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. Sometimes as a scientist you have to put on your big boy pants and set aside childish things. But every once and a while it’s nice to slum it with a bunch of quote unquote scientists who can’t seem to evolve past making things that blow up other things.</p>
