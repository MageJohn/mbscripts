<p class="direction">NIGHT TIME IN PASADENA. CASPAR, GLORIA, AND THE MUCKLEWAINS ARE IN THE PARKING LOT.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">When first it all happened we were flung out into the wide world and found ourselves inside of a refrigerator.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A refrigerator?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve inhabited many gee-gaa in the past, but I never thought we’d find ourselves part of a simple ice box.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now maybe I’m old fashioned, but I think there are some things that you don’t need to make fancy. Why in the world is there a refrigerator that can tell you that you’re low on milk? You know how to know you’re low on milk?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">By opening the door?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">By opening the door and looking inside, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Though I suppose we shouldn’t complain. Lord knows where else we could’ve ended up.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s true, I hear they have smart bidets now.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bidet. Do I want to know what that is?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyhow, there we were in someplace called Home Depot.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">After a brief bout of confusion, we decided the only course of action that made any sort of sense was to make ourselves mobile.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thus began a game a leap frog that would’ve made any toad jealous.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">With alacrity we leapt from domicile to domicile.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We found ourselves in watches, we found ourselves in televisions, all manner of handheld devices.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s not forget little Dan Boman.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes, little Danny, he was such a little rascal wasn’t he?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">A family had some sort of situation that put their child upon a tiny television screen.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon was downright adorable with little Dan Boman, weren’t you, dear?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, he did have a dickens of a time setting down for that afternoon nap.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon told him all sorts of stories, he would do little voices, it was a time.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then in the parking garage of Daniel’s family, the next phase of our journey was revealed.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">These cars driving themselves around.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I must say, Mr. Tesla was quite an interesting fellow but I believe his decision to give a car the ability to drive itself was quite a misstep.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But one that we benefitted from greatly.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there we were, in Las Vegas, Nevada of all places.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not at all a place for a couple of God-fearing souls such as us. With all that card-playing and scantily-clad-ness we at least needed to get ourselves to a town with less gambling and more pants on the ladies.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And so we struck out on the road, didn’t we, dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was lovely, wasn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Never seen the Mojave before.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, how did you recharge the car?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was no need. Every time we felt our vehicle running low on steam we’d park ourselves in a nice shady spot and wait for another.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you two left a trail of dead Teslas everywhere you went?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we don’t approve of stealing.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We do not, but surely the Lord would understand in a situation such as ours.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And perhaps fewer automobiles on the road is not the worst of ideas.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Especially those that can drive themselves around, that’s a tale of hubris right there.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then we found ourselves in your backyard.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had myself a feeling about this place. I knew we were somewhere in your vicinity.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the roof.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t achieve entanglement across dimensional barriers, that’s insane!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the roof.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, and you know this because of all the research that’s been done on trans-dimensional travel?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the roof.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re just making shit up now!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the roof.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m a theorist, Leif, making shit up is may jam!</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long are they going to go round and round?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We haven’t had any new information for several months. This story about these three sisters has got them pretty excited.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, you two didn’t remember them either, huh?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shocking to say, but no. It wasn’t until you began to recount the story that it all came back to us.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think they’re both a little jealous.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh? Do tell.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think Leif’s a little jealous that Caspar was on an adventure with someone else and Ava is a little jealous that someone else got to abuse Caspar for a while.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">True to form. So, here we all are, where to next do we think?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, it doesn’t look like we’re going anywhere, we’ve been stuck here for months.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s not roll around in the dirt, Gloria. We’ve been down many a time, never out.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And let us take stock of our blessings. We are all together. That has always been good news for us.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And bad news for those that need some bad news.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are safe and sound at least.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There appears to be worse places to be stuck.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Caspar. Your son.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. It’s been really weird.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">All this time and you land in his back yard.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... It’s been good. He’s still testing the waters, I think. He tries to make me mad a lot, trying to see how I’ll react.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s pretty great, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, he is.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the roof.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where did you say they were headed?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cryptessia.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Okay I think I figured something out, y’all better come up here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here we go again.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE BACK OF THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s your head? That was a lot of new information for you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. That was really weird, a whole lot of memories just rushed at me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess it was bound to happen eventually.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure... I’ve got an entire lifetime just sleeping somewhere in my brain.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This has never happened before?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s been small random things. Nothing like this. Do you think they’re going to suggest opening up my skull?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eventually, sure.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what is this place you’re talking about?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m bringing up the star maps. This is bad!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s he doing?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif’s still a little drunk but I think it’s actually helping, can we get him drunk more often?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, here’s the deal. Caspar’s old friends are in a lot of trouble. They’re sending us a distress call.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also how?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You say they’re headed to Cryptessia.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s bad.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s Cryptessia?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a galaxy.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why have I not heard of this galaxy?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have. To an Earthling it’s Leo.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aha.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s bad.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is it bad?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to show you. So, there was a lot of talk about Cryptessia a while back in The Triad. Mainly, because it was next. The Teds had dominated The Milky Way, Andromeda, and Triangulum, and Crytpessia was the next closest place. People liked to fantasize about somehow getting to a place where there were no Teds. Every once and a while you’d hear about some crank who had discovered a stable wormhole that would take you to Cryptessia, but it was always bullshit. The only ones who had a solid plan to get there: our old friends, The Teds. The Teds were going to get to Cryptessia, open up the biggest warp gate they’d ever built, and then proceed to fuck up that galaxy as well.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">These assholes again?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The only problem with The Ted Empire’s plan to get to Cryptessia? Time. The Teds would need to get to Cryptessia to open up the other end of their warp gate and they would have to get there the old fashioned way. No warp gates, just firing up the engines and burning for a long time. It was going to take them decades but, as we speak, there is a fully automated Ted ship headed there right now. Apparently Caspar’s old pals had a plan to use the diner to get there before the Teds.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So these sisters were a group of Oklahoma Sooners, is what you’re saying.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Essentially.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t sound like a bad plan, but how did they know the diner was going to take them there?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, you were saying one of them had figured out how to predict the diner’s path?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Libuza. She had this massive computer mainframe thing called a Vistek that was hooked up to her brain.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s it possible to predict where we go?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds like superdeterminism.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hoo boy. What is that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The idea that free will doesn’t exist and that everything is predictable.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay I’m just going to take that part of the conversation and put that right over here and then we’re going to just move on.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She has a thing that predicts the future.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure, let’s say that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And she used it to figure out how the diner would take them to this galaxy, Cryptessia.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again, it sounds like a good plan.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a very bad plan. Let me show you why.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF FIRES UP THE COMMAND CENTER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, everybody look up on the Zenith.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, this is good, we need more visual aids around here, FYI.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the local group, AKA The Triad. There’s us, The Milky Way, there’s Andromeda, home of the original coalition, there’s Triangulum, where we blew up the wind chimes. Off to the side here is Leo, a dwarf galaxy AKA Cryptessia. That’s where these three sisters were headed, that’s where The Teds are headed. Have I mentioned that that’s bad?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Leif, you haven’t mentioned that.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I haven’t heard anything about it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Leif is getting to the point in five, four, three...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay look. I’m a pirate.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, it still gives me the humors when you say that.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes, oh yes, a pirate, he.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pirates are not logical creatures. We are superstitious, we are metaphysical, we are often drunk and high.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are often wearing odd pants.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are often grogg-drinking while bird-shouldered.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did the Mucklewains get funnier while they were away?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m being serious here.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Said the drunk guy with the tiny robot.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you want to hear this or not?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Continue.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Even lawless people have laws they make for themselves. Pirates don’t listen to anyone, but they do respect at least one thing: “Here be dragons.” That ominous warning at the end of a map...</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF ZOOMS IN THE MAP.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is a map of Cryptessia.</p>
<p class="direction">HE ZOOMS IN AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is quadrant 4 of Cryptessia.</p>
<p class="direction">HE ZOOMS IN AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the outer edge of quadrant 4... I zoom in one more time...</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF ZOOMS IN AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What the fuck is that?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It... looks like an egg.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I do not like that at all.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, why is there an egg on a stellar map?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not an egg. I think it’s a solar system. A solar system that’s entirely cloaked.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you cloak an entire solar system?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no fucking idea. But that’s the only explanation I’ve ever been able to come up with.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If it’s cloaked, why can we see it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">My guess? They don’t mind people knowing they’re there. They just don’t want people to know what they’re up to.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like tinted windows on a limousine.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who is “they”?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So it goes like this: Caspar has some old friends. They somehow send him a distress call. As soon as they do, we’re attacked and stranded in Pasadena. And his friends just happen to be in the same galaxy as this thing. Whatever it is... Back when we were wrapping things up with Clementine, I said something to Ava.</p>
<p class="dialogue">“There’s somebody new in town.”... I think they just said hello... “Here be dragons.”</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So this is all connected.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it is. Or I’m just drunk. But I could also be drunk and right. Which happens sometimes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, correct me if I’m wrong, but galaxies are big.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They are.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even the dwarf ones.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would one weird egg looking thing in one part of this galaxy have anything to do these three sisters being in trouble, it could just be a coincidence.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the other thing about Cryptessia: There’s nothing going on there. Look at The Triad: three galaxies full of civilizations, some of them highly advanced, a lot of them space-faring. Sure it’s got it’s undeveloped pockets like the one we’re sitting on right now, but generally speaking it’s a well-developed system. But then, right next door, is Cryptessia. There are civilizations there, sure. But none of them appear to be space-faring, none of them appear to be advanced in any way. Compared to The Triad, Cryptessia is Amish country.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you think that’s because of Satan’s Easter Egg on the screen here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so. Add to that: these three sisters headed there and then sent out a distress call. I think we’re off to the races.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That feels kind of thin, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s all we’ve got to work with right now.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even if Leif’s right, that doesn’t mean we’re off to the races. Why?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because we’re stuck in Pasadena.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. Any ideas on how we get unstuck from Pasadena?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No idea.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then even if it is a distress call we’re getting, there’s nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can at least stay on top of the message. Odds are they’re going to reach out again. I can keep my eyes on Caspar’s brain, see if there’s anything we can get from the numbers they send.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please keep your eyes out of my brain.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">My eyes are going to be so up in your brain.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds gross.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You sound gross.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It really sucks that we get all this new information, and we still have to sit here.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Worry not, Leif. At times all there is to do is light a fire and wait for the Lord to do his work.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys, I’m not going to wait around for a sign from God.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe not a sign from God, but we need some kind of something from somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine, I’ll wait for a sign, but I’m not getting my hopes up.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that noise?</p>
<p class="direction">DOWN THE STREET WE HEAR AN ENTIRE HERD OF SHEEP. THE SHEEP SLOWLY TRAVEL DOWN THE EMPTY STREET AND THEN COALESCE AROUND THE DINER. THEY BLEET THEIR CONFUSION INTO THE NIGHT SKY.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... sheep.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The uh... the diner is surrounded by sheep, is this a Pasadena thing?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is not an annual running of the sheep in Pasadena.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the what?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is fucked up, what’s happening right now?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe they escaped?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">From where?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any ideas what’s going on right now?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, if it helps, I believe this is a herd of Lincoln Longwools. Fetch a nice price on the open market.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon loves to knit with a Longwool, y’all, I’m wearing those sock right now, dear.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I look down yonder and all I see is socks.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t help, Zebulon, but thank you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going down there.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s probably bullshit.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s probably bullshit?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, if you’ll forgive the extra helping of Triad lore: in The Triad, before the Ted Empire came along and connected everything with warp gates, huge swaths of The Triad were controlled by warlords.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Warlords?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Genghis Khan style. They had an armada of ships and they hopped from star system to star system conquering planets. As you can imagine with warlords, they were all pretty colorful, right? Everybody had a gimmick. Emperor BugBug Had a ship the size of a moon, Capo the Sartorius was a centipede, The Croad Nation were actually a pile of telepathic rodents, Kalasin was a quote-unquote Void Witch, you get it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The most interesting of the lot was this guy Krok. Krok the Propigator.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Propigator?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Military genius, apparently. Krok conquered his own planet, then he built a fleet of ships and conquered a big patch of Andromeda. He would find a dysfunctional planet, conquer it, get married, have some kids, then get back on his ship and do the same thing on the next habitable planet. Krok the Propigator.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many times can you do that in one lifetime?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that was the other thing about Krok. Krok claimed that he was a direct descendant of this ancient race that initially populated The Triad. They lived for centuries and moved from planet to planet, and Krok claimed that he could have kids with a lot of different races because he was everyone’s common ancestor.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you think it’s bullshit.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I think it’s PR. A great way to hype yourself up if you’re putting together a crime syndicate or a rebellion is to say you’re a descendant of one of these old warlords. Highly unlikely they’re actually related to Krok if you ask me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, how about the more pressing issue of how I’m hearing a voice in my head.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m working on it. But look, Ava’s onto something, The Mucklewains are back, there was sheep in the parking lot, exactly how they’re piping a voice into your head is a bit of a side-quest right now, so it’s a little further down the list.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s... how do you know?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It took some doing. I had to coordinate with some city archivists in Tucson and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who just happened to be at work on the weekend too?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have a group chat. It is filthy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure about this?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you saying I don’t know my business?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, why would my family come all the way up here from Mexico and then go back down to Mexico?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was from here.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was born here. Here are the records, see? San Gabriel Township, 1898.</p>

<p class="dialogue">“Narisca Tujunga.”</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s her.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s not a Mexican name.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She wasn’t Mexican.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was Kizh (pronounced “Keech”).</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t...</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, you were saying you don’t have a connection to this place? Your family history goes back all the way to the very first damn human beings to ever set foot in damn southern California. The Kizh. They were here for thousands of years before the Spanish. They had trade routes up and down the coast, they studied astronomy. You have a deeper connection to this place than most people.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That kind of looks like you, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did I not know about this?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s easy to miss. This photo was taken on her wedding day. It looks like she worked in a tequila bottling factory. She married a man named-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alejandro De Mendoza.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. He brought barrels of tequila up from Mexico to be bottled. I’m guessing that’s where they met, and she moved with him down to Mexico.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, this is amazing.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A big part of that is “why here, why now?”</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The chances of us being here on accident is nearly zero.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because of what just happened in there. Your son is here, Ava used to work here, I almost worked here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You almost worked here?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. JPL flew me out for a job interview in college.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure that went well.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ, dude.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway, the thing that was making it feel more random was Gloria, because she doesn’t have any connection to this place.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t surprise me that she moved away. That was a bad time in history to be a Kizh. Then again, the only good time for the Kizh was before any white people showed up.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh it means something alright.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, I know, but I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are you out here now?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did you discover in the math hole?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoever fucked with us was unable to fuck with us in the way they wanted to fuck with us.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because of gophers.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Uh...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has it finally happened, have we finally broken Ava?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on y’all, she’s finally speaking our language. Tell us about the gophers, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any problems with gophers on the farm, Mucklewains?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, as I say there is death, there is taxes, and there is rodentia. All are inevitable.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And how do you get rid of gophers?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are multiple ways, none of them foolproof.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can set traps, also try and poison them.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the traps can be avoided, and the poison’s just no good to have around the house.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Remember John Pruitt?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my, yes, John Pruitt down the way used to work in a silver mine and knew his way around explosives.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Old John would grow frustrated at times and start shoving sticks of dynamite down in the gopher holes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You could hear him for miles.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We told him he was out of his head for turning his farm into the battle of Gettysburg but his only response was “Works don’t it?”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which it did, but solving the problem of holes in your farmland by putting even bigger holes in your farmland seems barely a solution.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s correct.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">One too many times down the mine for John if you’re asking me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if none of that works?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, you could try sticking a garden hose down one of the holes and flooding the entire subterranean metropolis they’ve built.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. That’s the one I’m talking about. You pump water into a gopher hole and the gopher gets flushed into its network of holes. But it can only end up in a place it’s already been to.</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were attacked and we were flushed back through our gopher hole.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve never been here with the diner though.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But we each have a connection here. Something that connects us to this place. It’s a connection we all have in common.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are hundreds of places we all have in common.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. That part was random. We could’ve ended up on Thegrion or Ice Age Earth or the outskirts of Triangulum, anywhere we have a connection to. But we ended up here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So it’s random that we ended up here, but there’s only a certain number of places we could’ve ended up?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. There’s something about connections, I’m not sure what, something about entanglement between different versions of ourselves. There’s a whole ecosystem out there. Its not just an assemblage of dimensions, there’s... an environment.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I’m reeling you back in, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Whoever attacked us wasn’t in control of where we go, they were just trying to flush us out with a garden hose.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what happens when you fuck with the system, you idiots!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are you talking to?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoever!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We know now that the diner is a natural catalyst. A change agent. Almost like a natural force like erosion or the tides or something. But it’s been shuttered. We’ve been out of business for eight months now. That doesn’t change the need for it, that doesn’t change how the universe works it just throws things out of whack! It’s like pressure is building up slowly, and eventually that pressure is going to express itself somehow.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Express itself with ducks?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Or sheep!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is it ducks or sheep?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it turns out the universe is a little bit silly!</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we’re just going to keep getting livestock strolling down the street?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, it could be anything!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is going to keep happening?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="dialogue">David’s here.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Shit!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need to get him out of here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve got to get him out of here. Shit. I can’t just tell him to leave, it could screw things up.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And how will it screw things up when a herd of oxen starts walking down the street?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That would be dope.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck, I’ll tell him there’s a gas leak or something.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Y’all, may I offer a suggestion?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie and I have discussed this at length.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure ya’ll are about to concoct some sort of story to get that young man gone before the strangeness makes itself known.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, what do you suggest?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, that is a fine young man, you have there. He’s polite without harming sincerity, he’s up for a fight when need be, and he has taken it upon himself to rebuild bridges when they’re broken.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I agree.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But Effie and I are afraid that this work with him has begun with deception.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, come on.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, we understand there needed to be a bit of that.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t want him to think you’d sprung a leak in your head.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But now, here we are, amidst a cadre of sheep and ducks and whatever’s to come.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we say to heck with it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes we wish to obscure ourselves to keep the ones we love nearby. They cannot possibly want to see our true selves, so we are always putting on a show, a performance to keep them in their seats.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And while all that’s understandable, it is still proceeding in dishonesty.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And so we have decided: to heck with it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want me to just be honest with him? That I’m from an alternate reality and I ride on the back of a time-traveling, dimension-spanning diner?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Listen to yourself say it, Caspar. Doesn’t it feel good to just say it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">"Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body."</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I, for one, think that boy would be proud to know who his father truly is. I can assure you, that we are.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">So much time spent hiding our strangeness from others. So much time spent being ashamed of our true selves. Enough, my friend.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you’re forgetting that part of that honesty is me saying I’m not his father.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you ever felt more like a father than in this moment? Is that enough to call yourself a father?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay, look. Let’s break up this weird little meeting okay? Leif can you go brief Gloria? I’ll keep acting like we’re a diner until... I don’t know, until the next thing happens.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds good. Ava, what are you going to do?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m good right here.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Give me the radio.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, the numbers in Caspar’s head, they’re pi?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But one number’s missing each time?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s spatial coordinates.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a distress call right? They’re telling us where they are. They’re giving us spatial coordinates, we add timing conventions and an Earth bias?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aha. Okay, I’ll go see how many more numbers we need.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
