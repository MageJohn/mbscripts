<p class="direction">THE ROOF OF THE DINER. SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY WE CAN HEAR THE MUNGO LUMBERING THROUGH THE STREETS OF PASADENA. OCCASIONALLY ONE OF LEIF’S DRONES FLIES BY.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are things up here?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... The huge monster has moved into downtown Pasadena and is eating the tops of all the palm trees.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. They eat all day, that’s all they really do.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Probably for the best. Palm trees aren’t native to this area anyway.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">They planted most of them in the 1930s. It was a jobs program during the great depression.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s interesting.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There’s a lot of things not native to the area around here.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yeah... David, what was he supposed to say?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, what do you usually say to people?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We try and keep a low profile as long as we can, but then eventually things get so weird that we have to let the cat out of the bag... just like Caspar did with you.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What is all this stuff?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif lives up here. He sleeps in that hammock and this is his workshop. He calls it the command center.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does he do with all this?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve seen him do some pretty amazing stuff, actually. See this here? This is a, let me see if I get this right, a laser interferometer. You use it to detect gravity waves. They have them here on Earth but on Earth they’re about four kilometers long. Leif’s is the size of a toaster.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would you need to detect gravity waves?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um. We were trying to track down an out of control space goddess.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Uh huh... Why?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not sure why they needed it. Ava tells him to build something and he builds it.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, what’s he doing here? What are any of you doing here?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The same thing as anyone else, David, we’re doing the best we can.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">You left everyone in your life behind.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It was different with each of us. Leif was on the run, Ava was on a mission. For me, my parents were gone, the only real friends I had were Cesar and his family, but, I was kind of the weird lady who came over to the house every once and a while. The kids would show you how their video games worked, the tiny ones would want you to read a story. It was nice but you’re on the outside of it. Kind of a third wheel. All my other friends...</p>
<p class="dialogue">I started to not understand them when they talked. They would talk about dating apps, and getting married, and moving up in their career at, I don’t know, a shipping warehouse?... It was all getting really foreign to me really fast... And then there was this place... I’ll admit, I thought I was just going to see some cool stuff and meet some aliens... But I’ve had to fight an evil empire and slay a space goddess among other things... But, somehow that’s not foreign to me. I understand it...</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">How could that not be foreign to you?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Inside you right now there is the purest part of you, the essence of who you are. When you’re in touch with that part of you, when you’re using it, you can feel it. I hadn’t felt that before. I think if you’re lucky enough to feel that, you should stick with it, no matter what... But your dad... your dad just came in to use the phone.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How do you know what this gigantic monster is?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s not a monster, David, it’s just a really really big guy. They’re harmless for the most part but if they get injured they can get a little rambunctious. When we first saw one, there was a village nearby and one of them had a wound on its back so we had to help out before it trampled the village.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Help out how?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We managed to get up on it’s back and we put honey on the wound.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honey?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s nature’s antiseptic, David.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus fucking Christ.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a light day, I cooked for the whole village afterwards... It was kind of normal. Just a wounded animal. See, it’s not that bizarre.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF RUSHING WATER DOWN BELOW.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is happening down on the street?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... okay, it looks like the street has become a river?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">A river.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(Calling down below.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is the street a river?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the parking lot.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The street is a river.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. The street is a river.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is the street a river?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is a new thing. Ava’s theory is that, because we’ve been stuck like this for several months that this particular universe is having a little temper tantrum.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is happening!?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">The street is a river, Gloria!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a four-story monster threatening the Pasadena Playhouse!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is good, let it out.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the span of fifteen minutes the whole damn world has gone on tilt!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the government’s here!?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It happens sometimes.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Leif has a robot helper?!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Peter.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t care what its name is!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck?!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know...</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay... Take your time. Don’t freak out. I mean, freak out. That’s fine, but... What’s the real thing that’s going on? The real thing is... something happened to your dad. And ever since then he’s been doing the best he can. Sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding. That’s all he was trying to do with you... Just stay up here, okay? Right now I have to go downstairs and somehow prevent a war between Leif and the United States Government.</p>
<p class="direction">DOWN IN THE PARKING LOT. A RIVER IS RUSHING BY CAUSING CHAOS AMONG THE TEAM OF GOVERNMENT AGENTS SURROUNDING THE BUILDING.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Agent Parrino, how’re you doing over there? Looks like the street is a river now, did you bring your trunks?</p>
<p class="character">KYLE PARRINO FROM D.A.R.P.A.</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is this Leif? Where is this water coming from and what the fuck is that monster?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, easy with the “M” word there, buddy. The Mungo isn’t a monster, it’s just a plant eating megafauna going about its day. I’m sure you look like a monster to it.</p>
<p class="character">KYLE PARRINO FROM D.A.R.P.A.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, really?!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, not really. In fact it probably doesn’t notice you at all.</p>
<p class="character">KYLE PARRINO FROM D.A.R.P.A.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what all this is, Leif, but I know you’ve got something to do with it!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, I’m an impressive guy, but I can’t suddenly make a river appear.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, uh-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, okay, yes, I did do that once, I did flood a city to rob a bank but that was a long time ago, I don’t do that sort of thing anymore.</p>
<p class="character">KYLE PARRINO FROM D.A.R.P.A.</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A word.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">“What’s up?”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Look, I didn’t have a choice.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, considering our current situation, maybe just giving him the robot would’ve been the best choice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not giving him the robot.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can make another robot.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you have any idea what they were going to use him for?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, the last time we faced off with the government we had the benefit of knowing we’d be gone in twelve hours. We don’t have that benefit anymore.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can get us out of this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, I just need some time.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, the world is literally unravelling and you’ve decided to add “grudge match with the US government” to the top of the sundae.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria. How’s he doing?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s doing okay. He’s freaked out. He’s not sure what to make of most of it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, but he’s not going catatonic or anything?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. I think he just needs some space.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Vomit cannon?</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, hey, Agent Patrick Bateman, why would someone make a vomit cannon?</p>

<p class="character">JAY SPARK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we’re back, this is Jay Spark, I’m here with Jacqueline Snyder and we are trying our best to make sense of the news coming out of Pasadena and now spreading across the Los Angeles area. We’re told the airspace above the area is about to be restricted but we’ve still got our eye in the sky chopper up there, Jacqueline, what are we seeing right now?</p>
<p class="character">JACQUELINE SNYDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Jay, we’re seeing a great big monster aren’t we?</p>
<p class="character">JAY SPARK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes we are.</p>
<p class="character">JACQUELINE SNYDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is four stories tall, and it is currently traveling very slowly south down Lake Boulevard towards my favorite Trader Joe’s.</p>
<p class="character">JAY SPARK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We should note at this point that there have not been any casualties.</p>
<p class="character">JACQUELINE SNYDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">And thank God.</p>
<p class="character">JAY SPARK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Some light injuries from people fleeing the scene but this guy does not appear to be Godzilla, does he, Jacqi?</p>
<p class="character">JACQUELINE SNYDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well he is if you’re a palm tree. This big boy seems to be focused entirely on eating the tops of palm trees.</p>
<p class="character">JAY SPARK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bad news if you’re a palm tree, good news if you’re my Land Rover. Lost an entire windshield to a falling palm frond last year, remember that?</p>
<p class="character">JACQUELINE SNYDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh, that was a bad day in the studio for everyone, wasn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">JAY SPARK</p>
<p class="dialogue">But this parade float come to life is not the only thing going on in the City of Roses, is it, Jacqi?</p>
<p class="character">JACQUELINE SNYDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it is not, Jay. We were jokingly calling it the Colorado river, here in the studio. Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena has now become a raging river. We don’t know how, we don’t know why, but we did manage to capture the moment it happened with our eye in the sky chopper, let’s roll that footage.</p>
<p class="character">JAY SPARK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we see here a restaurant in Pasadena called Midnight Burger. Now, I’m no expert but there appears to be some sort of government standoff going on around this restaurant.</p>
<p class="dialogue">There you see the black suburbans, you’ve got men with guns and what looks like a squadron of drones in the sky right above the restaurant. Now, that raises enough questions, but watch this footage here... all of a sudden there is a raging river, and you can watch as these government vehicles, all of them, are completely swept away by this sudden river. Look at that.</p>
<p class="character">JACQUELINE SNYDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, that’s one way to end a government standoff.</p>
<p class="character">JAY SPARK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sure is. I’m not sure where those government agents got washed away to, but I hope they brought their water weenies.</p>
<p class="character">JACQUELINE SNYDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yikes, me too. Okay, so like we said these strange incidents are now spreading across the city so let’s go to the San Fernando Valley Buddhism Center where we are getting word that the Buddhists are levitating-</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, hello Los Angeles. I’m Gloria. You have no idea who I am, I know. I’m cutting into your local news right now because I’m sure a lot of you out there are scared and confused about the things going on in the city. Without going into it too much, because I don’t know how much time we have, I’ll say this: the world you live in is trying to fix itself. Fixing yourself can get really messy. It’s going to be messy. All that I, a strange woman who has just appeared on your television, want to say is: what’s the real thing that’s going on? Check on your neighbors, are they okay? Check in on the people in your life. There may be someone in your life who needs to hear the words “we’re going to be okay.” You should say that to them. You may not believe it, but trust me, when you say “it’s going to be okay” to someone, you’re always talking to two people.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stick together, and hang on, nothing in the history of the universe has ever been permanent... Are we still going?</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, anything else?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes one intrusion will supersede the other. Like right now, this race car thing superseded the river on Colorado Boulevard. Then, sometimes they can co-exist. So we’ve got the race cars and also the Mungo is still loose in downtown Pasadena eating all the palm trees.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where is all this headed, Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So sorry for the nay-saying!</p>

<p class="dialogue">You, shut it!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everybody inside!</p>
<p class="direction">THEY ALL RUSH INSIDE THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those things hurt way more than you would expect.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am officially sick of this, Ava is there anything we can do?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sadly, we’re just like everyone else now. With the diner powered down, we don’t have much to work with.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So this is what happens? When the diner stops working the whole universe collapses in on itself?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re seeing it right now. It’s happening just like it would with an organism. One system breaks down and that failure cascades throughout.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It can’t be that simple.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s not that simple. When any universe is created, the initial rush of energy and expansion takes literally microseconds, but this universe has had billions of years to develop and mature and gain complexity. That could take a long time to unravel.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And all that time it’s going to look like this? Ping pong balls falling from the sky?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, no, it’s going to get much worse than that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t believe we’re supposed to just sit here and watch everything turn to soup.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">As powerful as we all may have felt while were were bopping around the cosmos, in the end we’re still mostly observers. Trying to stop it would be like trying to stop a storm front by blowing at it really hard.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So this is it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Y’all, I must say, I disagree.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that now, dear?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we all seem to be drifting toward a rather apocalyptic view of things. We’re beginning to sound consigned to oblivion.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon, everything’s gone haywire and we’ve been stripped of our power to do anything.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I believe it is always a mistake for one to convince themself that they have any power at all. I have witnessed all of you do incredible things. Heroic things. And you have done those things not because of your immense power but because of your... Lord help me, for I am about to step right in it... because of your faith. Faith in yourselves, in each other, faith in your belief that to act from the purest part of yourself will lead you to victory. That is not power. That is trust. And perhaps what we need right now is a little more of that.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe this is the lack of sleep talking, but Zebulon’s right. I’m sitting here saying that the universe is unravelling, but that’s only going with the information that I have. There could be a lot of information out there that I don’t have. It’s entirely possible that a universe evolves to a point where it has a, kind of a back up plan. Something we don’t know about yet.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we just sit here and hope for the best?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome to Midnight Burger.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Sorry.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s okay.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a lot.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is, in fact, so much.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I still don’t know what to do with all this.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">David, I told you so much nuclear-grade insane bullshit earlier. The only difference between me and a severely mentally-ill person is that everything I said is true. But it still feels like insanity. It was, for real, raining ping pong balls a second ago, but it still doesn’t feel real. Like there’s no room for it in your brain, y’know?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I hitched a ride here from a teleporting lawyer.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would’ve introduced you but she had to go check on her neighbor. She was out on the street next to my apartment. She was trapped in this weird loop, she couldn’t escape the sidewalk, so I had to help her out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’d you do?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I held her hand and walked her to the end of the block. Somehow that did it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Well I’m glad that you’re making friends.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did that work?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava and Leif will tell you one reason why it worked, Effie and Zebulon will give you another. And then Gloria and me would say, it worked because something had to.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I can’t talk to anyone else about that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">That makes me mad.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry that it makes me mad.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">David it’s... Parents are tough... you may want to have a good relationship with them, but you can never really pull off having the relationship you want to. Also, you both go through life and you both change but when you get back together you revert to these old roles like no time has passed, it’s weird. Parents are weird, home is weird. Look at Leif. He’s grown a lot from the angry dude he used to be, but you put him back on Earth. Back home? And he’s just mad all the time, like no time has passed... it never works the way you want it to... This doesn’t work the way that I want it to. It never will. It doesn’t stop me from trying.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">Helping that Lawyer out felt good.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah?</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know that I’ve ever felt that way before.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s weird.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. It’s weird that it’s weird. “I helped someone?” “I changed things?” That’s not how the world is supposed to work, it’s supposed to be intractable. It’s supposed to be out of my control. And trust me it is intractable, it is out of your control, but every once and a while... Every once and a while you move the needle. And that gets confusing, because what are you supposed to do now? Try? That’s not what you’ve been told to do by the world you live in. You’ve been told to shrug your shoulders and keep walking. Now you’ve go to try all the time? That sounds exhausting.</p>
<p class="character">DAVID</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Is the world ending?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The world’s always ending, David. Maybe today, maybe tomorrow, maybe in a billion years. But Zebulon has given us his usual spiel, which means that we’re not allowed to say it’s the end of the world until it is the literal end of the world.</p>
