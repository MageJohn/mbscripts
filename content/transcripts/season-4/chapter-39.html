<p class="dialogue">Describe your relationship to the construct.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m sorry, I just can’t take you seriously with those voices anymore. Those aren’t your real voices are they? Hard to be casual right? Like, how do you order coffee? “Deliver to me a caramel macchiato, half whip.” Baristas would shit themselves... Wait, I’m seeing the appeal now, because that would be funny. Is it a bit? Are you having a little fun time over there with your boom boom voices?</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Describe your relationship to the construct.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s great. I’m pro big scary voice now. How can I get a helmet? I want to join up.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Answer our question.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t ask me a question.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Describe your relationship to the construct.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, here’s how this works... a question needs to end with a question mark, okay? Also it helps if there’s a little upturn at the end to get rid of any confusion. Let me show you: “Are you guys fucking stuPID?” Like that.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">We will continue to withhold food and water until you answer our questions.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fine but could I get a magazine or something? Ooh, do have Highlights? I really like finding the hidden objects.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 2</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have no magazines.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are authorized to use whatever means necessary to extract the information we need.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 2</p>
<p class="dialogue">We will also withhold magazines.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop it. Comply with our demands or or we will resort to harsher measures.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What’s the dynamic here? Are you two equals or is there somebody in charge? See, usually it’s the person who doesn’t say much who’s in charge but every time this one opens his mouth he sounds like a moron. Are you the guy who calls the shots around here?</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 2</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are equals.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure, but I mean, who’s REALLY in charge? Like, are you the one always fucking up and he’s the one who cleans up your mess? That’s the sense I’m getting.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are attempting to use psychological tactics to impede our interrogation. We have been trained to resist such tactics.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh? Trained? That’s interesting, trained by who?</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 2</p>
<p class="dialogue">At our processing point.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop speaking.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Processing point?... That’s interesting.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is your relationship to the construct.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Processing point... I’ve been trying to get a read on you guys since I got here. Processing point. So... it’s a regimented society, one in which people are processed like a resource. People are resources where you come from. Okay. But resources are meant to be consumed, consumed by who? There’s a hierarchy, then. So it’s a hierarchical society, but that could be a lot of things. Probably not a political one, y’all don’t seem like the voting type. Militaristic? No. No, you’re aggressive but not militaristic, you’re not trying to grab territory but there is a plan of some kind, right? Attacking us was part of some plan, who makes plans? It’s not a corporate structure is it? No, that really needs to exist in some sort of credited system where wealth can be accumulated. You’re not accumulating wealth—your technology is too advanced. So we’re not talking about wealth or power or territory—we’re talking about what?... Ideas. Somewhere out there is an ideologue. Yes. A philosophy. There’s a central philosophy to all this. Is it a caste system? People are born into a role, they play that role out until they die. No. No you’re both true believers, you believe in what you’re doing so it’s almost religion or philosophy approached like a religion, like it’s unerring buuuuuut... but you’re both also scared out your minds right now. Even through your stupid voice filters I can hear the fear in your voices when these interrogations don’t go well. What are you scared of exactly?... Aha... The Pharaoh... That’s it...</p>
<p class="dialogue">a single godlike emperor that paralyzes you with fear... so who is it?... Who are you scared of right now?</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 2</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We are striving to create balance.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There you go, Number 2. That’s what I like to hear, tell me more about that.</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop talking.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shhhh. Don’t listen to him, Number 2, he’s not even here right now, it’s just you and me. Talk to me about the balance... See, people like you, aggressive ideologues—that’s what you are, by the way, in case you were wondering—people like you generally don’t strive for balance they strive to advance, to push outward. That is, by definition, imbalanced, empires rise and fall. So if you’re striving for balance why do you attack things? You attacked us which must mean we’re the enemy of the balance you’re talking about. I’m sitting here, I haven’t had food or water for about twenty-four hours and you say it’s because you’re trying to create balance... Balance of what, Number 2?</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop talking to him.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you hear something, Number 2? I didn’t, it must be the wind... See, once upon a time it took the full might of an intergalactic empire just to trap us in three galaxies... You’re much more advanced than that. You can travel temporally, spatially. You’re the most advanced goons we’ve ever encountered, and we’re messing up your plans. And since we work on a universal, multiversal scale then... well, your plan has to be that big doesn’t it?... What’s the plan Number 2?... Balance... you know that doesn’t exist, right? There’s no balance in any universe, it’s all just lurching forward, nothing’s brought into balance. You do understand that, right?</p>
<p class="character">MYSTERY MAN 1</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have no idea what we are capable of.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yeah, you’re right, I probably don’t. But are you aware of what you aren’t capable of?</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN AND THEY EXIT.</p>
<p class="character">AVA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, come on, guys, it was just getting good.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR SLIDES SHUT, LEAVING AVA ON THE OTHER SIDE. THE TWO MYSTERY MEN WAIT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN REMOVE THEIR HELMETS.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck, that was so stressful.</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s so mean, why is she so mean?</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF AN INTENSE SCANNER SWEEPING ACROSS A ROOM, THEN SILENCE.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, here we are in this room.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I am unhappy.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am going to have so many words with that woman as soon as I see her face again.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It would be helpful to know her mind.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just a bit helpful, Zebulon, yes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wonder where we’ve been brought to? Some sort of enclave for our enemies? Some sort of foreboding castle?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been through the dang ringer with that woman and she just picks us up and drags us into a great big mess.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what is that loud contraption that keeps trying to have a look at us?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are the walls of Jericho going to tumble down if she shares with us what’s going on in that head of hers?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here it comes again, Dear.</p>
<p class="direction">A SCANNER SLOWLY SCANS THE ROOM ONCE AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, I’ve long since abandoned any expectations of politeness coming from her direction, but a few words right before we were snatched up? Is the creek going to flood if such a thing occurs?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, I understand your frustrations but perhaps we prioritize just a bit since we are trapped here in this... wherever we are.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s to be done, Zebulon? Alls we can do is sit here til there’s some sort of development.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here it comes again.</p>
<p class="direction">THE SCANNER SWEEPS THE ROOM AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Surely this wasn’t thoughtless of her.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we were on the way as she was headed to the door and decided to grab us up as an afterthought.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, does that truly sound like the Ava we know?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it doesn’t, the Ava we know sounds like this, “Oooh sciency-shmiency, I’m so smart, boop boop boop, obscenity.”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel as though you’re not quite capturing the essence-</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am unhappy, Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear. Can we, just for a moment, consider why Ava may have purposefully brought us along on this little sojourn of hers?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here it comes again.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY ARE SCANNED AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I suppose I’ll consider it for a moment.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright then. I think we can both agree that Ava did not do this as some sort of elaborate lampoon.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Alright, yes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">A bit mad? Oh yes, certainly. But we must assume there is method within that madness.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Must we?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">She made some sort of remark as we were swept away, something about our captors not knowing their upsides from their downsides.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I remember.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">“They don’t know what’s going on either,” she said.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you getting at husband?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you recall that time young Nick Howard came to the farm?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes I do, he was a shifty one that Nick Howard.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was going farm to farm, trying to see who was willing to sell and who wasn’t. You knew this, but you invited him in regardless.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I wanted to see what he was up to.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was trying to suss you out.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... And I went and sussed him right back.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava’s trying to have a look at our captors while they’re having a look at her.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Precisely.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It ain’t the worst plan in the world, but there’s a flaw in it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">For even after she’s done with all that sussing, we are still the prisoners of those we’ve sussed.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly...</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">BOTH OF THEM</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She intends for us to get her out of this particular mess.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which is why she has brought us along.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And which could’ve been explained if she’d only taken about a half a moment.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We could’ve had it explained to us better, that is for certain, but let’s not ask the impossible. She operates best within vagaries.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which I will be adding to the list of things we will be having words about. But now is not the time.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wonder what she means for us to do?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no way to know. Lets wait for this malevolent eye to take another look, then let’s start messing with things.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here it comes again.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY ARE SCANNED AGAIN.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Things went well for a while. We had structures built, the geothermal plant was working, we had two architects who were working on the initial city plans. That’s when they showed up. There were more of them this time, a whole army. Nothing I tried on them worked, they’ve all got shields that I can’t break through, and they’ve got weapons that can just blip you out of existence.</p>

<p class="dialogue">As soon as Caspar started hearing your message we were attacked. That’s when we were stranded.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>

<p class="dialogue">No. The signal would go in and out. I’m assuming because he was traveling.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you stay connected to it?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Entanglement.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cool.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">As soon as the signal came through strong again, I attempted to broadcast a message to him through the monitor. I imagine that’s when you arrived in this universe.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you see his vital signs right now?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can, but now their distorted somehow.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They must be on the move.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not stranded anymore?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we may have gotten pulled out of the mud. It was a whole thing about having two Cadillacs, I’ll explain later. I think we need to assume that they’re back on the move and they’re headed here.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just like Libuza said they would.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They could be headed anywhere, how do we know they’re headed here?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s one way to find out. The diner has a pre-print. There’s an energy signature that shows up a few days before the diner.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need to get out of here so we can try to detect that signature.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then we’re back to this. There’s no way we’re getting out of here.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe not. BUT... I’ve got a wild card.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I brought The Mucklewains with me.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The radio people? What the hell are they going to do?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh I think you’ll find the Mucklewains have expanded their portfolio since the last time you saw them... How’s Libuza?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still not speaking.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She blames herself for all this. She couldn’t see them coming.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has this happened before?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">With enough focus, we’ve found she can predict anything. She can miss things but only when she’s distracted or focusing on another prediction. She should’ve seen something this significant but it was a total blind spot for her.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I want to get a look at her math so bad, Kazi.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid so.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what is that path?</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s enough questions from you. Why are you like this?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">A bit more specificity in that question would be helpful.</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">This. You’re obviously highly advanced and yet this... this shell of an antiquated Earthling, I don’t understand. Why do you present yourself in this fashion?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s an interesting thought... I had on old friend. Ron Haydon was his name. Grew rice, as most of us wound up doing back then. Not much to him, Ron Haydon. The sort of fellow you could easily lose in a crowd. But one day, Ron was on his way back from church and something blew across his path like a tumbleweed. It was a hat. A dusty, black bowler hat. Wasn’t really the style in our part of the country, not quite sure where it came from. But he found that it fit like a glove when he’d put it on and well, now Ron Haydon had a new hat didn’t he? Now you could pick Ron out in a crowd. He was the one with a bowler hat. After a time, you began to see Ron change. A bit more confident. A man not afraid to speak his mind during town meetings, even managed to nab himself a bride after we’d all written him off as a bachelor farmer. It was as if he had been waiting this whole time for something to complete the picture. A centerpiece for the man he wished to be. Somehow it was a hat that completed him. Odd, don’t you think? It does beg the question, what makes a man? How do we choose to be the one we present to the world. What is the centerpiece that sums up our parts?</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is interminable.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I seem to be perfectly perched between niceties and skepticism over here. How do you enter into all this?</p>
<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is how the Shimislid function. We are the core matrix of the system. One that invites, one that attacks, and one that adjudicates between them.</p>

<p class="character">2</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon, can you understand our confusion when we are trying to interact with you?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course. There is quite often confusion from folks when I open my mouth, but sometimes that confusion is from my own wife, you’re not alone.</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">The wife. Your wife is a separate entity from you, but you are part of the same operational system.</p>

<p class="dialogue">We brought down your construct and trapped it on Earth. Why don’t you stay dead when we kill you?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">... This is the crux of it, yes? I see... “They don’t know what’s going on either”, that’s what she said to us... In my experience, things, from time to time, will not stay dead simply from you killing them. And I’m sure that must frustrate you. Are you certain you’re not the Romans?</p>

<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s my name.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not calling you that.</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s my name.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a ridiculous name, I’m not calling you that.</p>

<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we focus on something else, please?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re human. Or at least you look human. Have you got suckers on your hands under your boy scout uniforms?</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No? How about you, Sally?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>

<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">We... we didn’t know of your existence until recently.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Surprise.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were told that you were a pale imitation of us. That you were a malevolent race that was trying to slowly undermine ours and that you were a dangerous threat.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh... Were you and Allison over here a part of the team that abducted me from Earth?</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you’ve been to my planet?</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And does my planet honestly look like a threat to yours?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have the construct.</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I forgot about that part.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">That construct is incredibly powerful and it is in the hands of humans like you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The diner.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not a diner.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The diner that you attacked and neutralized.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">We thought we did.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then we broke free.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And we want to know how.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Let me test something out. Abigail, what have we done that’s threatening to you?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">What have you done?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, what have we done that’s threatening to you. We’re this huge threat to you apparently, what have we done?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We don’t-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t know. You don’t know how we’re a threat, you just know that we are.</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because that’s what you were told.</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re a direct threat to the balance.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah. The balance. We’re back to this again. What exactly are we the enemy of again, Brunhilda? What is this balance?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s what we strive towards.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Complete balance in the universe.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the universe?</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what’s that supposed to look like? “Complete balance in the universe.”</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">The universe tilts forward to a catastrophic end. It’s a straight line into oblivion. We’re going to take that straight line and make it into a circle. An unending balance.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh... You know the milky way is currently flying through the universe at a speed of 1.24 Million kilometers per hour... There’s also something out there called the Great Attractor that’s currently pulling about 100 galaxies toward it at around 600 kilometers per second, we don’t know what it is but we know that it’s big. But that’s nothing compared to the fact that the entire universe is infested with dark energy that is constantly pushing everything apart and will eventually lead to something called the Big Rip, where the universe expands to such an enormous size that space and time literally shred themselves and the universe, counterintuitively, reaches zero size and all distances diverge to infinite values. We get so big that we become small. But you’re saying that you guys are going to, what? Balance all that out?</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">By bringing our minds into balance.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your minds.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our minds and the minds of everyone in the universe.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your minds.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your minds are going to stop galaxies from uncontrollably careening through the universe towards their inexorable destruction?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">We say “A mind creates a body, a body creates a house, a house creates a world, a world creates a galaxy, a galaxy creates a universe.” One day the Benefactor will harness the power of all the minds in the universe and he will use that power to bring the universe into balance.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once his work is complete, there will be no more destruction or pain. The universe will be a circle, constantly in balance and we will live in that balance forever.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Wow... I must say that is the stupidest bullshit I’ve ever heard in my life.</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">You say that now, but you’ll see.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No I won’t, and neither will you. How far off is your big boss man from achieving his dreams? How much of the universe does he control?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have control of this entire galaxy.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really, Millicent? A whole galaxy?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s impressive.</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You realize there are between a hundred billion and two trillion galaxies in this universe, right?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There are?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. How many did you think there were?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know... Five?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Five? Sweet Jesus, Marian. Oh wait. Okay. Right. They’re keeping you both real dumb so that you don’t peek behind the curtain, is that it?</p>
<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Peek behind what curtain, there’s a curtain?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is amazing... do the two of you know anything about the universe you live in? No, of course you don’t. Your minds are being harnessed to to create the balance... You realize that to harness the power of someone’s mind you have to keep them real real dumb, right?</p>
<p class="character">RIGO</p>

<p class="character">DEIRNTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s just that, usually we do a bunch of exercises and I’m not complaining I just... I’m kind of in crisis right now and I would like to do something that makes me happy.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hello.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kazi keeps us on a very strict sleep schedule. It’s not really working for me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never had a regular sleep schedule and look how I turned out.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t know when things are going to happen.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Obviously.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been able to predict things for a long time now, even before I was connected to my machine... They severed my connection to it and now... I didn’t realize how dependent I was on it... every time someone speaks it’s terrifying... I didn’t mean to do this to myself... In the art of prediction, many of the people who devote their lives to it end up going mad... I didn’t think that would happen to me but I’m afraid now that it did. Have I driven myself mad?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s possible. Tesla thought Mars was trying to talk to him, Newton became obsessed with Biblical prophecies, Oliver Heaviside replaced all his furniture with granite blocks, so... madness is always on the table.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re a scientist?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m a theoretical physicist.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ever wonder if you’re losing it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh sure, all the time. I just never had an intense desire to have it in the first place.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How’s Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think he’s pretty worried about you.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds like him.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How worried should he be, Libuza?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Have you ever been very wrong about something?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Kombucha. I never thought it would catch on.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Publicly I’d say no. But I think it’s better to think of it as having increasing degrees of rightness rather than being wrong about something.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... My sisters and I were born a very long time ago. For as long as I can remember I’ve been working on the Vistek... It took me so long... it failed us and now I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you tell me how it works?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How was it supposed to work?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Prediction engines are mostly unreliable. You can’t predict a particle’s path without knowing its previous path. The past determines the future. For it to truly work you would need to know the full history of every particle in the universe. I thought I could circumvent that by going back to a time when there was no past, only the future. I had to observe the beginning of everything.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you went back to the Higgs Field?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. In the first few moments of the universe, what humans call the Higgs Field changed and everything suddenly had mass. In those brief moments everything in the universe was concentrated together. If I could collect all of the observations of the early universe I could see everything before it became something. I could see the whole universe in its infancy and since there was no past in that moment, I could extrapolate forward on everything.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s pretty amazing, Libuza.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It worked so well, for so long. Really the only flaw was my interpretation of the data, not the data itself. It brought us to the diner. It brought us to Cryptessia. It should’ve told us about... whoever these people are. I don’t know why it didn’t.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds like you missed something.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have comprehensive data on literally everything, Ava. There’s nothing for me to miss.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we’re not going to figure it out talking through the wall. Let’s get out of here and we’ll figure it out together.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what you’ll be able to do.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, you’re not the only one who tracked down the diner using a pencil and paper.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never used a pencil.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I think we’ve found your first mistake. Pencils are great. Pencils can change your life.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When you hold a pencil in your hand, you’re holding all the amazing things you’re about to do. They’re the greatest repository of potential energy in the universe.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Speaking of us getting out of here, did you say the Mucklewains were going to get us out of here?</p>

<p class="character">RIGO</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have they?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay kids. Let me tell you how this works. Once upon a time there was a planet. And on that planet was a small group of beings. Beings like you.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Beings like me. They were dumb, as most beings are in the beginning. They lived in caves and ate whatever didn’t kill them. They lived in squalor like that for thousands of years, not knowing any better. But then one day one of these beings picked up a stick. And for the first time in the history of his species something happened: he had a thought. “I can pick up this stick, and I can hit something with it. I can take the things that surround me, and I can use them.” Sadly the first thing this creature probably did was kill someone with this stick. But lo and behold this stick has more uses than bashing someone’s head in. Soon they had tools and huts and weapons. Turns out they can make things and pass that knowledge on to others. Life changed, the people changed, and slowly a very evil and seductive idea infected all of them: “I can control the world I live in,” they said to themselves. I could take you through the whole history, they all follow the same path, but how about we fast-forward? Thousands of years go by and look how our little group of cave dwellers has fared. They have cities now, and spires that reach to the sky, and throw in some other futuristic thing, flying cars or something, I don’t know. Look at how well they’ve done. We’re so proud aren’t we? What’s next for them, I wonder? They’re starting to look to the stars now. They’re starting to imagine a great kingdom that spans the universe. They are finding new and interesting ways to live even longer lives. Soon they’ll live forever and be the masters of all they survey, there are no limits, even the sky... And then a meteor hits their planet and all of them are fucking murdered... How it works is: people like to say that the universe is a harsh and uncaring place, but for the universe to not care about you is to assume that it ever considered you in the first place. The universe? It doesn’t notice you. It has never considered you. You are not on its mind. You are just a particular configuration of dust. You are a rounding error. You are the least of the universe... Has anyone ever controlled it? Give me. A motherfucking. Break.</p>

<p class="dialogue">They are digesting your book.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Bit of a task, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why have you chosen this book?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a fine book for discussion. One that I’ve come back to time and again. I had scarlet fever as a child. Nearly died. As I waited for my father to return from the city with the medicine I needed, I was in search of anything that could take my mind off the abject misery I was feeling, and I found myself taking down off the shelf an odd book by the name of Gulliver’s Travels. As a child I was fascinated by the stories of giants and little people and talking horses, but it does seem to be one of those books that, when I return to it, it seems to change as I change. I thought it would be nice to discuss it with some new friends.</p>
<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where do you reside, Zebulon?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me? Well, I reside at my home with my wife.</p>
<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">That device in our possession is meaningless, isn’t it? Just a set of wires and an ancient liquid battery. Where do you reside?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hmm. Not just looking for our postal address, I see... The Egyptians saw the soul of a man as many parts, each with their own aspect. It was Plato, I believe, who divided the soul in three: reason, spirit, and appetite. The Stoics had some sort of thought about the soul being breath, made of air and fire. I believe the Mesopotamians saw it as residing in the liver of all places.</p>
<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s funny, that. People seem to talk at me as if I know the length and breadth of myself. Who else gets talked to in such a fashion?</p>

<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Explain.</p>
<p class="character">2</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon. I think you may not have understood our game.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have I not?</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">The point of the game was to use the book to debate the viability of human beings as a species.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I understood that part.</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have presented us with a book that concretely proves the inviability of human beings as a species.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have I? Well then this shouldn’t take long at all, should it?</p>
<p class="character">2</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we explain?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please.</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll sum it up thusly: in this book, the protagonist is asked to explain to the Liliputians what a lawyer is. He responds: “A society of men among us, bred up from their youth in the art of proving by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is black and black is white, accordingly as they are paid.”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I haven’t had much of a turn with lawyers in my life but it does have the feeling of accuracy, doesn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">2</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon, the author goes on to prove that all of humanity works in this fashion.</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">The book describes humanity as creatures given the gift of a complex mind only to use that gift to rationalize their base animal instincts. Not rational, but rationalizing.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s fascinating. You know I haven’t heard it put in quite that way, well done.</p>
<p class="character">2</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s... there’s nothing to debate, Zebulon.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is the source?</p>
<p class="character">3</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t determine the source, the system is overburdened.</p>
<p class="character">2</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our system is infallible.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Infallible. Well, if that doesn’t sound like a rationalization, I don’t know what does.</p>
<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">How have you done this?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s an interesting place in life, to be considered a hayseed. People will ignore you completely, or write you off as a relic while they go about their lives.</p>
<p class="character">1</p>
<p class="dialogue">Purge the system.</p>
<p class="character">2</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can’t, we’re trapped in a feedback loop, the system is paralyzed.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, you all sound busy. Bout time for me to go. Apologies for not continuing our conversation, it is an interesting book. I must say, you all remain a mystery to me. What’s all this about? Suppose time will tell. There is a thought I wanted to leave you with, though I’m not sure why. It’s true, at it’s heart, Swift’s book is a damning portrayal of human society. It’s hard to not feel yourself a bit roughed up by the time you reach the end of it. At the end of it, Gulliver was so scarred by what he learned of humanity that he could not even stand the sight of his own wife and child. It’s a hard thing to read that book and not give up on the entire project of humanity writ large, compounded by the fact that, at times Swift’s stance is one that’s very hard to argue with. Not rational beings, but rationalizing. Using our gifts to attain our animal desires... But I do have one response to Swift’s book... it is a book. Books end. Humanity does not.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Swift, like those before him and those after him tried to take all of humanity and compound it into a nutshell. Sum it all up. I’ve faced many a demon in my day, but none are more insidious than simplicity, the desire to reduce this great kingdom to black and white, night and day, good and evil. The inclination to suck the plurality out of a world so wide. That will most definitely destroy us before our selfishness. And for whatever reason, I thought you all should hear that...</p>
