<p class="direction">WE HEAR STRANGE BIRDS CALLING IN THE DISTANCE. WE ARE ON AN ALIEN PLANET. NEARBY WE CAN HEAR A CAMP FULL OF PEOPLE TALKING AND CHILDREN PLAYING. IN THE DISTANCE WE BEGIN TO HEAR INTERMITTENT GUNFIRE, AS IF SOMEONE IS DOING TARGET PRACTICE. WE HEAR A COMMUNICATOR ACTIVATE.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Teta, can I speak with you?</p>
<p class="direction">THE GUNFIRE CONTINUES.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Teta?</p>
<p class="direction">THE GUNFIRE CONTINUES. KAZI BEGINS TO WALK TOWARDS THE GUNFIRE. IT GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER UNTIL IT’S DEAFENING. WITH EACH SHOT WE CAN HEAR SOMETHING EXPLODE.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you turn off your communicator I have to come all the way over here to talk to you.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t turn it off.</p>
<p class="direction">TETA RESUMES TARGET PRACTICE.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Supplies are getting low in the camp, do you think this planet has any food sources?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are we again?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Azules.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where the fuck is Azules?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think that matters.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What would you like me to do? Start killing things until I find something that tastes good?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">That would be fine. Thank you for your help.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long do we stay?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Excuse me?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long do we stay? How long is this supposed to take?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is our last stop, Teta.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not according to Libuza.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we just stay here until it all falls into place?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many times have we been over this plan?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know I don’t listen during the planning meetings.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Start listening, then.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a kid in the camp, I think he’s from Lemonier. All he does all day is find rocks and sticks to make a model of the house he’s going to live in once we get there. He doesn’t know where “there” is, and neither do we but he knows what his house is going to look like. He is now running out of things to add to his house, because he’s been doing it for so long.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why should I know about this?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because if we lose that kid, we lose everybody.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyone at this camp is free to leave anytime they want.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No they’re not. Do you know why? Because we’re on Azules. Which I’ve never heard of and neither have you. The only way they can leave is with the ship we came here on. Which means the only way they can leave is by taking the ship from us. I’m not going to let them take the ship from us, which means that if they get fed up and sick of waiting then I’m going to have to start killing people. Which is fine. But I feel like that’s not part of the plan.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re welcome to take the ship if they want. This is our last stop.</p>
<p class="direction">KAZI STARTS TO WALK AWAY THEN STOPS.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to go talk to her, would you like to come?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO AN ISOLATED CLEARING IN THE WOODS. WE HEAR A SOUND ROLLING IN AND OUT, LIKE A DIGITIZED OCEAN.</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Good.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They are all too far into the journey to turn back now.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not surprising.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you tell us if anything on this planet is edible?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can tell you we won’t find out.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... I’m sorry this part still confuses me, does that mean I’m supposed to shoot some animals or does that mean I don’t even try.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It means you wont even try.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I don’t know why. That’s not the story I was told.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were saying you were worried about overheating.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had to rearrange different data nodes. There’s a low power mode now. It can sleep.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are the implants?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They hurt less.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good, it means your body is accepting them.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If we stay here much longer the Teds are going to be on top of us again.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ll stay here as long as we need to.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously, is there any way I can get a time-frame on this?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t work that way-</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We won’t be here much longer. But they will be coming for us. You should be ready, Teta.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. See? Was that so hard?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Libuza, I’m concerned about the weather on this planet, do we need to get the Vistek under cover?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No... we’ll be inside soon.</p>
<p class="direction">FAR OFF WE HEAR A LOUD CRACK IN THE AIR. THE DINER HAS JUST LANDED.</p>

<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s here?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Libuza, you said a ship.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it is... of sorts.</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(To the crowd.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone remain calm. Stay here. We’re going to investigate.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t even... Is it from Earth?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It appears to be... Do you have orbit alerts on?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, if anything shows up near this planet, I’m going to know about it.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">No alerts?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So it just appeared.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess?</p>

<p class="direction">INSIDE THE DINER, CASPAR IS CLEANING THE COUNTERTOP WITH A SPRAY BOTTLE AND A RAG.</p>
<p class="direction">SONG: I’M A PILGRIM, I’M A STRANGER BY THE IMPERIAL QUARTET.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Appears to be quite a collection of the concerned outside.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s quite a mess of folks out there, Caspar. You think you’ll be able to handle this many customers? Probably the most we’ve seen thus far...</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Situations such as this calls for soup or perhaps roasting a whole pig.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No time for a pig roast and you’d have to wait for soup to boil. I’d get to making sandwiches if I were you, Caspar...</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR STOPS CLEANING THE COUNTER AND WALKS INTO THE KITCHEN.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m set to give up on this one, dear.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Surely he can’t ignore us forever.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hush up, here they come. Hoo lord, this is colorful duo.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR CHIME SOUNDS AS TETA AND KAZI WALK INTO THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what we’ve been waiting for?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that was “I’m a Pilgrim, I’m a Stranger” by the Imperial Quartet. I’m Zebulon Mucklewain here with my wife Effie.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, Y’all.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we’re here doing our level best to bring the holy to the holler.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, do you know what I was thinking about the other day?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that, Dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bread.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can really pull a loaf of bread out of that oven can’t I, Husband?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, you most surely can, dear.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes I’ll look at that loaf of bread cooling on the rack and I’ll just sit back in my chair and I’ll think, “Effie Mucklewain, you have gone and done it again with that loaf of bread, you ought to be in a magazine of some sort.” I’d think to myself “I’d better not share this bread with my neighbors, as they would surely never be able to reach to the great heights to which I have brought them. Any bread they have from here on out will taste like a horse apple.”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And don’t any of you go asking me how she does it.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no, that’s useless. He’s watched me do it a hundred times and yet he’ll try and make a loaf for himself and his bread comes out looking like we’re about the flee the land of the Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is truly confounding.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then, when I am at the heights of my confidence, right when I feel I am doing nothing but pulling manna from heaven right out of that oven, what happens?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happens dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Suddenly that grace has left me. Suddenly that bread is as flat as the day is long, and I may as well be making hard tack. And there is no explanation for it. I do everything the same as I always do but something just ain’t right.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know to make myself scarce on those days.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He does. Because I cannot be spoken to. I’m there in my kitchen, face to the ceiling, saying “Lord. Lord, what the heck are you doing to my bread pan that makes it suddenly produce something not fit for the hogs outside?”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is not exaggerating, she definitely speaks to that ceiling.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then I remember the words of my mother. I remember that she always said “The greatest baker in the world can’t out-bake the weather.”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">When the day is not right, it’s not right.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there ain’t a damn thing I can do about it, excuse my language.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what should one do on those days, dear? On the days when, despite all efforts, the loaves are not what they should be?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Husband, alls you can do is remember that each good day is like a coin. And each of those coins have got another side to them, don’t they? And you can’t have a coin without having both sides of it.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is this?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">In keeping with that theme, let’s hear a bit from the Trinity Quartet, “Break Thou the Bread of Life”...</p>
<p class="direction">SONG: BREAK THOU THE BREAD OF LIFE BY THE TRINITY QUARTET.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m not.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought I told you to leave the gun outside.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did leave the gun outside, this is the other gun.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... Hello.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome to Midnight Burger.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is this place?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a diner.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s not.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that’s the only name I have for it.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it does that.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are you?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">...He’s an Earthling.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you get here? Earthlings don’t leave Earth.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe I’m not an Earthling, maybe I’m just good at impressions.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve just scanned your DNA, you’re an Earthling.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, glad we cleared that up.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what is this place, how did you get here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You woke up here or something?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I walked in to use the phone.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The phone.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s how Earthlings talk to each other... Start at the beginning.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe you should start at the beginning.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe you should start at the beginning since I’ve got a gun and you don’t.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I was on Interstate 5 and I needed to use the phone. I saw this place. I walked inside and it was abandoned. The radio started playing... and then... And then the whole thing started traveling.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Traveling how?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Like uh... on a TV show when the ship goes into warp speed or whatever, it was like that.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This place.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Earthlings don’t have technology like this.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, no shit.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No one does.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yet.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Have a look around.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about him?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s fine. He’s an Earthling, he couldn’t be less threatening.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay. Shout if you need me.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t ignore your comms this time.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You make it sound like this place abducted you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Call it what you want. I walked inside and then...</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long have you been here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you get here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I told you, I walked in.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re on Azules right now, do you know how far from Earth that is? It’s not even in the same galaxy.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That’s pretty far.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what I mean is, how did you get from there to here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wasn’t on Earth before I came here, I was somewhere else.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So this place just... moves?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. About every twelve hours it leaves, then for about twelve hours it... travels. Then it’s a new place. And then it leaves again. Over and over like that, never in the same place.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... A ship that cannot be steered.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Twelve Earth hours?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, yeah.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ll need to move fast, then.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This place is... I don’t get it, there’s no technology, there’s no power source. It’s just... It’s a restaurant from Earth.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no control panel? Nothing?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s fucking weird. I don’t like it.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve got twelve hours.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Twelve what?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Twelve Earth hours.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kazi, I don’t like this. In fact I hate it.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the plan.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Twelve hours to do what?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Every twelve hours you go somewhere new for twelve hours, is that how it works?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">As far as I can tell.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re going to have some company for a while.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">For a while? What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re really doing this?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many times do I have to talk to you about the plan?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is insane, we don’t know anything about this place.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is the plan?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve got twelve hours to get everyone packed and moved.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re insane.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">From the beginning, this plan has been insane. Every step. And after every insane step you are right there along with us, so can we skip the part where you argue with me, please? There’s no time.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit... okay, here we go.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get Libuza first and then we’ll move in everybody else.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If this kills us, it’s on you.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fine.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone else, what are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">One moment please, I need to change my circadian rhythms to an Earth schedule.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shh... Alright... My name is Kazi. That was my sister, Teta. She’s about to get our other sister, Libuza. We have one hundred and sixteen refugees with us. It’s going to be a tight fit, but it won’t be forever.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A hundred and sixteen? Wait... coming in here? For how long?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our other sister is... a very special person... she can predict things. She knew that this place, whatever it is, was going to show up on this planet, in this place, at this time.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t see how that’s possible.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Eventually? For how long?</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know how long I’ve been here but I think it’s long enough to know that I’m not... I’m not getting back home again. I think if you’re banking on this place taking you where you want to go, you may end up completely lost.</p>

There were a lot of things I was trying to figure out and then this place happened and... you can get more lost, trust me. I know I did.

<p class="dialogue">What machine?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, whatever... What were you in prison for? Something violent, I’m assuming?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, why would you say that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just saw you bring in three bags full of weapons and the first thing you did was point a gun at me.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the first thing I do to anybody.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were in prison for insurance fraud, then?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Don’t take this the wrong way but, why in the hell would they do that?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I don’t know if you know this, Caspar, but we’re kind of a big deal out there in the system. We are revered, we are feared. The name “The Sisters” strikes fear into the hearts of fascist shit heads everywhere.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I don’t see how that’s genetically possible.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s because you don’t know our father.</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">No matter what?</p>

<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I don’t know about you all, but I need a fucking drink. What a day. I’ll be inside with all the other stinkers.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. What about hygiene?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a truck stop shower in the bathroom.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Truck stop?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a shower.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the water comes from?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fantastic question.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright. Oh. And the radio?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What about it?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was talking to us? Are you in communication with someone or is it some sort of simulated intelligence?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You hear it too?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... They talk to you too?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I knew it was a radio but I didn’t... I wasn’t in the best mental state when I came here... I’m sure you can probably imagine what I thought about this place at first.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you think you were hallucinating?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wouldn’t you?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not prone to hallucinations, are you?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How would I know?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Probably not.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shh.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Your eyes keep changing color.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m switching lenses.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How come your eyes keep switching lenses?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because that’s how I designed them.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You designed your eyes?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I designed most parts of my body.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... you ever thought about wings?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course. You can’t just add wings, you really need a transformation of the whole body for aerodynamics. Hollow bones, etcetera. Too much trouble.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Anything cool? Like claws?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a claw. You don’t want to see it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was kidding.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. Your brain looks fine. I don’t quite understand how your neurons are working right now, but I don’t spend a lot of time on Earthlings.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You scanned my brain for insanity?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. You’re not hallucinating, Caspar. The radio is actually talking to you. And I’m actually standing right here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t make me feel better.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. Now, speaking of scans, there are still several people inside that need medical attention, so I’m going to deal with that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s for dinner?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’ve been living on ship rations for months, so the bar is low.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That helps.</p>
<p class="direction">KAZI WALKS INSIDE.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you tell me what it looks like?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh... Uh... Not really but... Do you remember what the stars at night look like?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">My planet only had one side that faced our sun. Most of my life has been night sky.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. So imagine the night sky... And then take the night sky and wrap it into, like, a tube.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then take that tube and stretch it. Stretch it so long that all those stars become long lines. But then take another night sky, one you’ve never seen before, and add that on top of the sky you know, then do that about an hundred more times... and then every once and a while there are little flashes of light, far off. Like something very big happening from far away. You’re traveling through that tube.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And at the end?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds beautiful.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it is.</p>

<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t be scared of my sisters.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re pretty intense.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’ve had to be. We’re fugitives.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fugitives from what?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kazi’s home is a barely habitable moon called M-Lynn. Her people learned to manipulate their own bodies so they could survive, but then the practice was banned. Kazi refused to stop, and now she’s considered a criminal. Teta’s a brilliant engineer but seems to only be interested in making killing machines. She’s often in trouble with the authorities.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about you?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Predicting the future makes people uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">People are always trying to predict the future.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. They get uncomfortable when someone else can do it and they can’t.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can really do that? You can predict the future?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I found you, didn’t I?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does it work? Do you have visions?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes. It also speaks to me. But it’s hard to understand what it’s really saying. And then underneath the voice is usually embedded data.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does it sound like?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s sounds like... I believe Earthlings call them fairy tales?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It tells you a fairy tale?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">For instance, the part about you went like this:</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Then the seer saw a man. The man would travel in an impossible ship. A ship that could go anywhere, but could not be steered.</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the seer could see where the ship would go next. The three sisters boarded the ship and traveled a long way. And just as the seer foretold, it brought them to the far off land where they would build the city in her visions.”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So you’re off to some new place? Where no one is hunting you? Where there’s no bad guys?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s bad guys everywhere, you know.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, I can see them.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But not where you’re going?</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. But bad people are headed there. We’re going to get there first and keep them out.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see... you know there was this time on my planet when a lot a people discovered there was a whole continent that they didn’t know was there. A lot of people decided they would leave the old world behind and start over again in the new one... They wound up just bringing the old world with them.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Should we not do anything because of the dangers of doing something?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good point, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We make the world, Caspar. Not those before us.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">My whole life, all I’ve done is live in somebody else’s world. Seems pretty unchangeable to me.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s just a fun trick that they pull. If you made a world wouldn’t you want to convince everyone that it couldn’t be changed?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re very astute for a young person.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m older than I look... I’m also very tired. Can you bring me inside?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... sure...</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>

<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m from Lehari. Lehari was in a power vacuum and that led to a civil war. When you’ve got infighting you’re easily conquered, so the civil war we were fighting was secretly being funded on both sides by an intergalactic empire of fuckheads. Pull!</p>

<p class="dialogue">You were going to end the war with a radical peace treaty, I’m assuming?</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I was going to end the war because my guns were like, WAY better.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">TETA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, I’m forced to go on the run, and that’s when I get a mysterious message from my two sisters.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, so no one’s explained to me yet how a man has three daughters on three different planets. That doesn’t make any sense.</p>

No rhyme or reason to it for me... “Effie I am sorry, that I have been so rudely ignoring you and your husband this whole time, seeing as how you, clear as day, are only concerned for my well-being.” Well, make no mention of it again, Caspar. I can’t imagine what you’ve been through since we first met... I just wish you’d let us help you... Well, that’s enough of that. I’m off to bed. Again. Take a page out of my book, if you can.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who was he?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Krok.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Krok.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. A long time ago the galaxies were ruled by warlords. Warlords and conquerors. They had fleets of ships and they would hop from star system to star system claiming territory. Our father was one of them.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He would conquer a planet and then have some kids and then just move on to the next planet.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Essentially.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And everyone was just okay with that?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not like they had much of a choice, but apparently he was quite charming.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You never met him.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, he had moved on by the time I was grown.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you go from that to being fugitives?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">A new age got ushered in. An age of warp gates and commerce and politics and all of it run by... shitheads, as I believe you say on Earth.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m familiar with them.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">The warlords and conquerers were all seen as a threat, that included the inheritors of their “unique genetics.” A lot of our brothers and sisters were made irrelevant, turned into hollow figureheads, some of them killed... the three of us refused to go quietly.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see... but none of that matters anymore because you are off to a new world.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. Cryptessia. A young galaxy just out of reach of the shitheads.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is all of this going to be worth it?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hope so, because you’ve got a hundred people in here, Teta almost died today, Libuza is... I don’t know what the hell Libuza’s doing to herself.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Libuza’s the reason we’re all here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Libuza is a kid and she’s had things put into her skull.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Libuza made a choice to more fully integrate herself with her creation, it was a very brave choice.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you just said okay?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who do you think installed those nodes in her temples? And she’s not a kid, Caspar. Regardless of how you perceive her, she’s much older than you can possibly imagine. That age of conquerors I was telling you about wasn’t last week.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The three of you are going to strike out into new territory and you think it’s all going to be easy street because your sister made a science project. You’re going to get yourselves killed.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Well... I’m flattered, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve grown attached to us.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Stop looking at my brain.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I sang it to my son to try and get him to go to sleep.</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see... That’s a very depressing song to sing to a child.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, when you’re trying to get a child to go to sleep, you grab any song you’ve got memorized, okay? It was either that or the banana boat song... don’t ask me about him, okay?</p>
<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t need to...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

They deserve a good place... okay... okay this was a good talk I’m glad we had this time together.</p>
<p class="direction">BACK OUT IN THE DINING ROOM. PEOPLE ARE GATHERING AROUND THE RADIO.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright, gather around y’all. You children up front settle. Everyone can hear us alright? Alright.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome all. As I’m sure you all know, I’m Zebulon Mucklewain here with my wife, Effie.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, y’all.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve spent time with y’all for many a day now and I must say, we’ve been inspired by your presence. All of you here with us today have taken it upon yourselves to seek out a new life, out there in the great wilderness. It’s surely a daunting task and one not taken on lightly, I’d imagine. And I find that in those times, when one has taken on a great burden, it helps to hear of those who have taken on a great burden themselves.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">When one takes a great burden upon themselves, a great loneliness can settle about.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Indeed. A great purpose requires great strength, and for whatever unknown reason, the strong must, at times, know loneliness.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we imagine all you strong people here with us today, must feel quite a bit of loneliness.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the strong are never alone for long. To be strong, to be forthright, to be unbending to the oncoming trials of the world. It is a beacon to those who seek their own strength. They will find you, grow stronger because of you, and you will in turn find strength in them.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">After all, y’all had flung yourself out into the great beyond with only your fortitude as your guide. And when you did, there we appeared to you.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And it brings me to the story of a boy named Ishmael. Ishmael and his mother had been cast out from their home, into a wide and unforgiving desert.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And after searching for days for safe harbor, Ishmael’s mother despaired, for surely this desert would take their lives. But Ishmael, even as a boy, was of a different sort. As his mother lost all hope, Ishmael screamed to the heavens that he would live. He did not hope to live, he did not beg to live, he demanded to live. For what is the use of a wide world, if not to provide for those that fight to live within it? And there in the barren desert, Ishmael’s demands were met. For suddenly there was a great spring, and a great oasis, and a tree bearing fruit.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">People like to say that the world don’t owe you nothing. And perhaps they’re right. But who makes the world, children? Is it a world of our making? Did we not build spires to the heavens and humble homes and the streets we walk upon? And if it is our world that we had made together, then perhaps from time to time it behooves us to raise our voices and say to the sky that we demand to live.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we send salutations to those of you out in that great desert, demanding to live.</p>
<p class="direction">THE LAST DAY. THE DINER HAS LANDED IN A SWAMP. CASPAR IS IN THE PARKING LOT WITH LIBUZA.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Yeah, that is a very large volcano.</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">A lot of the planets in this system will be like that. It’s a new galaxy, a lot of the planets haven’t decided what they’re going to be yet. Besides, we need active geology if Teta’s going to build us a geothermal generator.</p>

<p class="character">KAZI</p>
<p class="dialogue">We won’t be spending much time on “could,” Caspar. We’ll be spending time with “should.” We’ll be okay. Libuza we’ll guide us and Teta and I will do the rest.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was my pleasure... Honestly I think the whole time I’ve been here I’ve just been... I don’t know, getting from one day to the next. This was the first time that... It felt like time was passing. I know that sounds weird.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have to tell you something.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well maybe it’s time for a tune up of your terrifying device... Libuza I’m never going to forget you.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then... I’ll say this. If one day you forget about us, and somewhere far down the line, you remember us again. Please forgive yourself. I forgive you. Just remember that even if you forget us, we still met you and knew you... and we were inside you somewhere the whole time.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. But I promise I won’t forget you.</p>
<p class="character">LIBUZA</p>
