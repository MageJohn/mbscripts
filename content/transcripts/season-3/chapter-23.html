<p class="direction">THE SOUND OF A BUSY DMV OFFICE. A PHONE IS RINGING.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ma’am I agree that when we send you a notice saying that your license is suspended that we should send it registered mail but sending things registered mail requires more money and the fine people of this city voted to cut our budget last year because we had too much money apparently. You can’t have it both ways, you’re going to need to pick a lane which apparently you have a very hard time doing because your license is suspended. Now please fill out this form and mail it to this address alright? Thank you... 322? 322?</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR PICKS UP THE PHONE.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello?... Yeah, look I can’t talk about this right now, I’m slammed, okay? We’ll.... We’ll have to talk about it later, I’m not doing this now. Goodbye.</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR HANGS UP.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">322? When you sign the wait list you need a first and last name okay? Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. That’s me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s your last name, Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. I don’t have one.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t have one.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Can I get one here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Clementine, you cannot get a last name at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Is there anything else I can help you with?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... Yes, I think there is, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happens here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">At this window? Licenses, registration, suspensions.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean this whole place.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The DMV?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that what this building is called?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a gigantic sign out front.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Okay. And what do you... do here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Ma’am. Your number is 322 and that unlucky gentleman over there, he just picked up the number 403. Does that give you an idea of the amount of people I have to get through today?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like I should know this by now. I’ve been around, Caspar, to a lot of different places. I guess I’ve always followed what interested me and that never led me into buildings like this.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Municipal buildings aren’t meant to be a Hall of Wonders, Ma’am, it’s meant to be a place wherein one’s arrival is always unfortunate.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You talk funny.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ma’am. If you don’t have any business here, I’d appreciate it if you’d be respectful of all the other people who are here and, like me, don’t want to be.</p>
<p class="direction">IN THE DISTANCE WE HEAR A CELL PHONE RINGING.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure... sure, I have to go anyway.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Darn.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be back though.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. 323, Courtney DuPona?</p>
<p class="direction">THE CELL PHONE GROWS LOUDER AND LOUDER. THE DMV FADES AND IS REPLACED BY AND EMPTY STREET. ONE CAR DRIVES BY AND EVENTUALLY THE CELL PHONE IS ANSWERED.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Cesar... Yeah, It’s all locked up. Do you need anything over there? We’ve got all this food, it’s just going to go bad. Need 5 pounds of jack cheese by any chance?... Yeah, I’m hearing a lot of people saying “how long could it really be?” And I have to say I have a bad feeling... No, you can’t come help me... No, Cesar we have to stay away from each other, if I get you sick Inez is going to kill me... I’ll be fine, sign up for unemployment right now, okay?... Okay, bye... Fuck my life.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. We’re closed. Everything is.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is everything closed?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait... a virus?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s this place?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is my place.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh, right. You’re closed?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">For how long?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">According to the State of Arizona, one month.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Until the virus goes away?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Laughing.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Yeah, until the virus goes away.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fucking hell.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s so funny?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re just walking around talking to strangers today? Today of all days?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You from Desert View or something? Taking a little field trip?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...I mean, I guess this is a good time for it. No cars on the road, it’s a ghost town.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happens after a month?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">After a month? Well, then it’s back to business as usual, of course.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kinda sounds like you don’t believe that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t. But what do I know?... You’re supposed to be wearing a mask, you know. I think you can get a ticket or something.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be okay. You’re not wearing one either.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s in my car. I wanted one more day.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You seem pretty sad.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... everybody’s got this look on their face. Everybody on TV. This half-assed positivity. Nobody’s buying their own bullshit. They’re handing out this plan and if we stick to the plan everything will come out great. They all know we’re going over the edge of the waterfall and nobody knows how high it is or what the fuck is down there... This thing’s going to take everything from me.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This place of yours, it’s everything to you?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It really is. I busted my ass to get it and now... suddenly the streets are empty... What a mess.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You know I’ve never had a taco before.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That doesn’t surprise me... You know what? Wait here. You have the honor of being my very last customer.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="direction">IN THE DISTANCE WE HEAR A PARTY.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone! Can I get your attention for a moment please?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll be right back, okay?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE MOVES TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE PARTY.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you so much for coming to my farewell party, though I am convinced that sixty to sixty-five percent of you are here to make sure you don’t miss out on any gossip. Sorry to disappoint, but I won’t be doing anything more embarrassing than actually being a professor at this shit-sack of a university.</p>
<p class="direction">LIGHT LAUGHTER.</p>
<p class="character">AVA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Today I officially transitioned into emeritus status, the flaming viking boat of academia. I did so under viscous rumors that I have lost my mind, which I shall wear as a badge of honor. I am proud to join the ranks of other nutty professors like Paracelsus, who believed in giants, Tycho Brahe who wore a copper prosthetic nose after losing his real one in a fist fight, and Pythagoras who had an inexplicable fear of beans.</p>
<p class="direction">LAUGHTER.</p>
<p class="character">AVA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You only get one chance to make a parting statement, so here goes.</p>
<p class="dialogue">As we struggle to understand the universe, we may need to consider the idea that the universe is struggling to understand us. That our curiosity about the cosmos, may be reciprocated. Do our telescopes pointed skyward pose a question, and are the ebbs and flows of the starways an attempt at an answer. Are the scientist and their subject like two lovers in the dark; stumbling towards each other, hoping to find some skin... well, that got a little sexy didn’t it?</p>
<p class="direction">LAUGHTER. SUDDENLY TIME SPEEDS UP AND WE SPEED THROUGH THE REST OF THE EVENING, STOPPING AT THE END OF THE NIGHT.</p>
<p class="character">AVA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good night everyone! Drive safe, there are dangerous deer out there! They LOVE going through your windshield. Can’t get enough of it.</p>
<p class="direction">FRONT DOOR CLOSES. AVA SITS AND POURS A DRINK.</p>
<p class="character">AVA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that, as they say, is that... Oh....</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hark. A straggler.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I liked your speech.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks. Did I make a speech?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, it was at the beginning of the night.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah. Feels a million miles away. Who are you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, that’s a name. I don’t think I’ve seen you around. Are you one of Dr. Baker’s little backup dancers? He’s always changing his lineup.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s Dr. Baker?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what I say Clementine. Who is Dr. Baker?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s a poodle.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A poodle?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Inside joke. He’s one of those standard model jack-a-napes. You know the ones. Elbow patches, pipe-smoking, has children who hate him. Like a cliche eating itself from the inside out.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Standard model of physics, Clementine. Keep up. Standard model, standard poodle. I started calling them all poodles.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Okay.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay but seriously who are you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I heard there was a party.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Boy, there was wasn’t there? Thank God for booze. It’s perfect for letting smart people enjoy stupid things.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why’d you have a party if you think they’re stupid?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I said something about a flaming viking boat in my speech didn’t I?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was kind of putting on my own funeral tonight.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re dying?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but my career is, which feels like death. But I did it to myself so I figured since I was the one that killed my career I should probably be the one to give it a funeral... You don’t look like a an undergrad. Grad student?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why don’t I look like an undergrad?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve got this look about you. The look of someone who knows a few things but has no idea what to do with it all.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that’s about right.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d you end up at a faculty party? Are you dating your professor?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No shame, it happens to the best of us. Not to me, but to the other people, it happens to them.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I uh... I was out somewhere and just sort of got swept over this way.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I recall that about college life. It’s late at night, you have a drink in your hand and you’re looking around thinking “Who’s house is this?”</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Turns out it’s yours.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like it. What are you studying, Clementine? Let me guess... something useless... Philosophy?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Damn.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... History.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I was right about the useless part.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Studying history’s useless?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure it is.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if you really need to know what happened?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I suggest you just wait around. It’ll happen again. Would you like a drink?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I shouldn’t.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Presbyterian?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I drink... I need to stay in control or things get weird.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird? How weird?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, the boundaries of reality collapse in on themselves, stuff like that.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Clementine what are you doing in my house?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re having a party.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not anymore.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Why are people so obsessed with their careers? I see it all over the place. No matter where I go. I saw these coal miners, in this place called Wales, they were on strike and they were fighting with police and getting put in jail. They were fighting for their lives for these jobs and the jobs were... hours out of the day down a long, dark shaft under the earth. They were fighting for that.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What else could they do?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It seems a strange thing to fight for.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s all they had, I suppose. If you took that away from them, who would they be? “This place called Wales.” You talk funny Clementine, do you have a brain tumor or something?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did have amnesia for a while.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, this is getting more interesting. Do you have it right now? Do I need to throw you down some stairs?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d you get it back?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just needed something to remind me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was it?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was the coal mine in Wales. I saw a deep, black pit and the darkness reminded me of where I was from.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cincinatti?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The suburbs of Cincinatti?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is all this so important to you? Why are you calling this a funeral?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I made a terrible mistake, Clementine: I let it define me.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I convinced myself that this place and my office and my army of terrified teacher’s assistants was all I had. It started to define me so I had to kill it. That’s the problem with careers, they start to define you and you start defending them instead of defending yourself. I started defending myself and my career jumped in front of the bullet.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You talk in this weird way where things keep changing position.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m a scientist, is what I mean. I’m a scientist, my career is not. My career is now gone and look at me... still a scientist. The career part is just about people looking at you, and owning a nice house in upstate New York.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s an award.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What for?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was the lead on a very large study about gravity waves.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s a gravity wave?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A gravity wave is, oof, you’re a history student and I have to explain gravity waves to you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Umm. Do you know what a supernova is?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. In the massive explosion of a supernova, all kinds of stuff comes out. Like Iron. Iron is what made this planet.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And gold.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And gold, correct. Look at you. Despite the fact that all kinds of things get flung out into the universe during a supernova, 99% of what gets released are neutrinos. A neutrino is very small and has almost no mass. When a neutrino hits you, you don’t even notice because it can barely even interact with your physical body. But a supernova is so powerful that it can bombard you with enough neutrinos to completely obliterate your body, and it can do that from 100,000,000 miles away.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ouch.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ouch, indeed, Clementine. And a supernova, as powerful as it is, is child’s play compared to a gravity wave.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How powerful is a gravity wave?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Way off in deep space we observed a gravity wave. Two black holes collided and we sat there on Earth and watched. The gravity wave that the two black holes released generated 36 septillion yottawatts of power.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that a lot?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, Clementine. It’s greater than the energy generated by all of the stars in the universe combined. And that was an average one.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But here’s the thing... here’s the part of my acceptance speech for that award that made everyone in Belguim pee their pants... That supernova I talked to you about, it could obliterate your body with Neutrinos. A gravity wave? A gravity wave could obliterate the fact that you ever existed in the first place. A gravity wave can erase you and all memory and evidence of you.</p>
<p class="dialogue">A gravity wave can be the cosmic bent paperclip sending the cosmos back to factory settings.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s terrifying.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It can also not be that.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. There’s no way to predict it. Sometimes it can be nothing, sometimes it can be total obliteration, and then sometimes it might just turn your socks pink.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, so, a gravity wave, it can change things unexpectedly. Like one minute, something is normal, and the next minute-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pink socks, or suddenly the dinosaurs are alive, or magic is real, or the pacific ocean is chocolate syrup.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, it can be a good thing. Like if you like chocolate syrup that last one is a good thing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody likes chocolate syrup that much. And how would the migrating gray whales feel about a chocolatey sea?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But it can be a good thing, right? A big change like that, it could be a blessing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the problem with total annihilation, everyone wants to imagine they’re the one who made it out alive.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE IS VERY SUDDENLY BACK AT GLORIA’S TAQUERIA.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Tacos... Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Hi. Okay. Oh... look at all of these.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Crash course. Carnitas: simple. Slow cooked pork, shredded, spiced, put in your taco. Barbacoa: originally from the Caribbean, you ever wonder where the word barbecue comes from? There it is in your taco.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tacos Al Pastor. End of the 19th century. A bunch of Lebanese people show up in Mexico and they say “hey, y’all ever thought about taking that big slab of meat and spinning it on a spit grill?” Presto, Tacos Al Pastor. And then: Carne Asada. This is very important, Carne Asada is a food but it’s also an event. “Would you like to come for Carne Asada on Sunday?” Like that. It’s also a symbol, as in “You are invited to the Carne Asada.” You are trusted, you are one of the family. Got it?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t really like to think that way.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why not?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I don’t have the power to change things. Why bother thinking about shit like that?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know because... because maybe one day you will. Maybe one day you’ll wake up and suddenly have the power to change things.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody wakes up suddenly having the power to change things.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They do. Have you heard of Ashoka the Great?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ruler of India. A long time ago I guess? His father passed away, and he woke up one morning as the ruler. After fighting a bloody war with a neighboring kingdom, he realized that he was the ruler of his kingdom, but still doing what his father expected of him. So he stopped going to war and became a Buddhist. Converted most of his kingdom to Buddhism too.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re kind of describing it like anyone can wake up one day to find they’re the king of India.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think they can.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, I like the optimism, I’m kind of getting a contact high being this close to a bunch of optimism like that but, what am I supposed to do? Go to sleep at night hoping that I’ll be the King of India in the morning or should I maybe do something more productive with my life?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just asking you what you would do. It’s not going to kill you to imagine you’re the king of India for a second.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok fine, I’m the King of India. What now?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not really the King of India I mean... You can change whatever you want to change. What do you change?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. Well, where do I start? Uh... several bad hair choices.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Think bigger.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Colonialism.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay but, now a little more personal.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s pretty personal.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what I mean.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. It took a lot a planning to get to this place. I worked hard on the plan. If I was waving some kind of magic wand around I would just say “Hey, respect the plan, Life.” I don’t need a lot, just for the plan to be respected. I mean, they’re saying now that all this, the empty streets, everyone hiding inside, is all because of a bat in China. And here I am in a taco joint in the greater Phoenix area and a Chinese bat is fucking up my life. How am I supposed to function in a world like that? ... I lost my parents when I was eighteen. Something coming out of nowhere like that is terrifying, so I started making plans. The plans worked for a long time, but now. Now I don’t know how to live in the world anymore... So that’s all I would do. I don’t need to convert India to Buddhism I just need everybody to stick to the plan, y’know? Props to your friend Ashoka though, convincing a whole kingdom to meditate must’ve been a pain in the ass.</p>

<p class="dialogue">People rarely come off the way they actually feel. The calm ones tend to be the most nervous, the open and loving ones tend to be the control freaks, the devoutly religious, consistently, the biggest sexual freaks you’ll ever meet in your life... You wouldn’t know it to look at me. When I was young I was pretty mad. Mad at my parents then mad at my planet then mad at the universe. That anger became pretty important to me. Living in that anger was more important to me than the people in my life were. I lost them and held onto the anger. And then, one day, I wasn’t angry anymore. When I realized that, I took a look around and everyone was gone. Now I’m on the outer rim of Triangulum, about to give up my only possession. Pretty inconvenient that time only moves forward.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Tell them the map is upside down.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Here’s the problem: all of the men looking at the map have spent a lifetime telling everyone that they are really good at looking at maps. They’ve written books about their amazing map-looking prowess, they have toured the world making speeches about the their magical map-looking abilities.

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s shocking to hear.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And when you don’t know a lot about the world you have to go with your instincts. My instincts tell me that you would actually like to answer a question from a total stranger.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you spend your one break out of the day arguing with someone on the phone. Nobody asks questions in a argument. I imagine you miss being asked questions. I imagine you miss someone being curious about you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Ask your question.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What were you arguing about on the phone?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... My son. My son is... well, he’s very smart and that’s a problem.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t sound like a problem.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is. Try and imagine it on a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum you have total dummies. And those dummies, god bless them, are very happy. But then as you travel across the spectrum and people get smarter, their happiness level gets lower and lower. Eventually you get to a point where someone’s high intelligence is now actually making them unhappy.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because now they’re so smart that they can’t take the world at face value anymore. These are the people who always see the bad news in the good, they can’t celebrate small victories because there are so many more to win, give them a free car and they think about the yearly maintenance fees. These are the people who can find a lead lining in every cloud.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that’s your son?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, that’s me. My son, well he’s several steps past me on this scale. He thinks that literally everything in the world is stupid. A farce. Everything’s a facade to him... Try convincing a kid like that that he needs to do his homework. It’s not like there are many kids out there that like doing their homework but few of them flat out refuse and then cite the fact that Finland has banned all homework and have better educated students than most countries. That’s my son. He’s twelve.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He sounds like an interesting kid.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a lot of really interesting, really lonely, really miserable people out there. I don’t want him to be lonely and I don’t want him to be miserable. And I make him miserable. I try not to but something always gets the better of me. I worry about him a lot and it makes me do stupid things.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh yes, Tiny.</p>

<p class="dialogue">He’d often recount to me that in his wanderings through those trees he could hear the call of one particular grouse that he could not seem to set eyes on. Over many seasons he would always hear it’s call, yet could never manage to get it in his crosshairs. It became quite the obsession. His own little feathered white whale off there in the brush. Every spring he would return from an excursion quite vexed, always hearing its call and never able to find it. Then one day he realized his folly. There was no grouse. One of our neighbors who would hunt at the same time as my father had himself a very convincing grouse call that he had whittled out of a tree branch. He’d spent all that time searching for something that didn’t exist.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s a shame... I’m going to have to do something about that. I’ll try not to make it hurt.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know you’re up there, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Frank... How’d you know it was me?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was either you or eight tiny reindeer...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...You can yell at me again if you want.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Hey, is there a frisbee up there?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... this round thing?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll bring it down.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE LEAPS TO THE GROUND.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does it do?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Give it to me and go stand over there.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Now what?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Keep your eye on it. Three... two... one.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good catch.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What else does it do?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s it.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fun... I’m scared to throw it back.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m also scared for you to throw it back.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Thanks for not yelling at me.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What good would it have done? It was a year ago, here we are now.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a year ago?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Weird, I thought I was getting better at that. I’ve been really distracted.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything okay?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. It will be... Where’s June?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s one in the morning, Clementine. June’s either at her home, someone else’s home, or the bar.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Sorry. What are you doing here?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I sleep here sometimes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Why?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly I sleep here all the time. I came back to town when I took this place over after my dad. I haven’t really worked out where I live yet.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your Dad, he passed away?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">He did, yeah.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">My... I lost my mother.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You remember.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... I was uh, I don’t really know how to explain it but it all came rushing back to me. All at once. I had to remember losing her all over again.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fucking terrible, Clementine. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m okay. Now I’m okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t imagine having to go through that twice.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was good that I did. It was good, it... It made me decide something.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That I’m never going to lose anything ever again.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That... sounds pretty impossible.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s just because you don’t know me, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...If you could bring him back, would you?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a bad question to ask yourself.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, I know. It’s crazy. But just come with me into the craziness. If you could have...not Bring him back but... if you could’ve made it all never have happened, would you?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think anyone would.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if there was something you had to do to make that happen? Is there anything you wouldn’t do?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No... I hate to say it but no, honestly there’s nothing I wouldn’t do... I miss him all the time.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Thanks for not asking me a bunch of questions.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve decided I don’t want to know the answers to any questions I have for you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t take that the wrong way.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wont... Hey, do you mind if I stay here tonight?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we are a motel.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It feels safe here. I can pay you. I’ve got, hang on... I’ve got this, does this work?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...That looks like about a thousand Canadian dollars, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that enough?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">At least it’s not more gold.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t bring up the gold. You’re in room 7. The door’s unlocked, key’s in the bedside table.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fun.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you need a bucket of ice?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I think I’ll go right to bed. I’ve got a big day tomorrow, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah, what are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not doing anything. But there’s all sorts of things I need to undo... Goodnight Frank.</p>
