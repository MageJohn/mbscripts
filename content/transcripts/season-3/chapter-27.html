<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank?...</p>
<p class="direction">SHE WALKS INTO THE OFFICE.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank?...</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR STATIC ON THE RADIO.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was a particular bend in the river near my home where I would go if I needed to be alone. Is that what this place is for you, Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I thought I put you in a box somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are there still.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then what are you doing in the radio?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid I don’t have an answer for that particular question.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I want your voice out of my head.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">As a man who has been married for many a year, I certainly understand the desire to not hear my voice for a time.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you able to do this?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again, if you seek answers on that, I will disappoint you. There are many a mystery around my wife’s and my existence, but it’s strangeness does seem to have a certain mode. My wife has a sense of things, she seems to be able to see what’s coming. And myself, well... when I speak things seem to happen.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I seem to have no control over the effect my words may have, but I suppose that’s not much different from anyone else. I suppose we all speak without knowing what will come of our words. Once they leave our lips, we lose any control we’ve had.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then how about shutting up completely?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah, but I’m afraid being unable to control the interpretation of one’s words does not release one from the obligation to speak. Control what you can control, and leave the rest to God.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamn, no wonder she wants you to shut up.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, it’s very frustrating.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Well, say what you need to say, then.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Release us from the prison you’ve placed us in, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How have you been?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good. I’ve been good. How long has it been?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, about six months I guess.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good, that’s what I was thinking.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What have you been up to?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I had some business to take care of.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Some business, Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that didn’t sound right did it?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds like you were doing something shady, were you doing something shady?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Some things. Is that better? I had some things to take care of so I... I took care of them.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Congratulations.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I feel... I feel good about it, I think things are coming together... I feel good. And, I don’t know, suddenly I found myself here.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You feel like celebrating.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Yeah, I think I do. So...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you came here.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going on in there?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Brunch.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Brunch.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Brunch is a combination of breakfast and lunch.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It’s night time.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, it is. BUT. This is the Sheep’s Eye.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Sheep’s Eye is a bar that prides itself on doing things ass backwards, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So they have brunch at night?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">They do. The owner of the Sheep’s Eye is a man with the most ridiculous name in America. I tell you that because you really need to be prepared before you hear this man’s name. Are you prepared?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The owner of The Sheep’s Eye Roadhouse is named T.J. Peppercorns.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That can’t be his real name.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It can’t be, you’re right. But he insists it is.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I thought my name sounded made up.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway, TJ does not like being told what to do. Over the years there has been more and more people building ski chalets and upscale cabins up on the mountain. They’ll roll into town on a Sunday and just be flabbergasted that there’s nowhere to have brunch. After about the one thousandth request from one of these fur-lined newcomers, TJ finally said “fine, fine, okay”. And now he has brunch. On Sunday night. When all the people he hates are asleep.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He sounds like quite a guy... So I went by the motel just now, there was nobody there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. We’re having a staff retreat.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A staff... isn’t the staff just you and June?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m having this cigarette and then I’m coming back in and I’m kicking your ass, I’m kicking your ass, and I’m kicking your ass. Get ready.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve started up a darts tournament inside.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve all bet our pants. I will be going home with three pairs of dude’s jeans tonight.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your pants?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to sling them over my shoulder triumphantly like deer pelts—OH SHIT.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine’s here.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, June.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s me.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Carmen motherfucking San Diego.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How have you been?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine was just telling me that she has just taken care of some business.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, what a lovely mafia-esque parlance.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Indeed.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Congratulations on your business.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apparently Clementine feels like celebrating a little bit.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She does?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is she going to mysteriously disappear after?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Probably.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">C’mon.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, you have definitely come to the right place to celebrate. One problem, you cannot buy cocktails with gold.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, it’s central Oregon.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, who am I kidding, you can totally use gold, they would love that.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I probably shouldn’t drink anything.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You shouldn’t have said that.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?!</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I shouldn’t.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then I’m afraid you have stumbled into a bear trap there, Clementine. Because not only do I excel at winning dudes’ pants in dart games, I also excel at irresponsibly pressuring people into drinking.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, God.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let the peer pressure begin. Inside, lady.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, if you say so.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do!</p>
<p class="direction">THE SOUND OF THE SHEEP’S EYE FADES IN.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So how’s your plan been going?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Last time we talked you had a pretty peculiar plan.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, right.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re never going to lose anything ever again.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever that means.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. It’s going good. I decided to be proactive. Instead of hanging on to the things I didn’t want to lose, I’m trying to get rid of the the people that could take things away from me.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh. And how do you know who those people are?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes you just know, y’know?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not really, but it sounds like you’ve put a lot of thought into it so who am I to judge?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not doing anything mean. I promise.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m trying to... I think when people are trying to take something from you, they really want something else. It’s about something else. So what if you helped them get the thing they actually want?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess you’d have to be sure you know what they want.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am. I’m sure.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great, then.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You sound skeptical.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, we’re having maybe the vaguest conversation I’ve ever had in my life, there’s no room for me to be skeptical.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry. I know. It’s good, it’s going good.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dinks drinks drinks.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my god, what are those?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bloody Marys, it’s brunch remember?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do we drink them or eat them?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Much like how brunch is breakfast and lunch, a Bloody Mary is a food and a drink.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a lot of stuff on it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The stuff is optional, the important part is the drink part.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I still don’t know if it’s a great idea for me to drink.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a great idea.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I start acting weird, stop me, okay?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You already act weird, Clementine. What’s a little more weirdness?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like, really weird though.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. You showed up at a bar wanting to celebrate your wins, right?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then let’s do that, Clementine. It’s victory lap time, right?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Glasses up, party people, cheers.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cheers.</p>
<p class="direction">THEIR GLASSES CLINK. THEY PAUSE AS CLEMENTINE DRINKS HER ENTIRE DRINK.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Uh...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Gasping.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh wow!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You okay?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was really spicy.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never seen someone shotgun a Bloody Mary before.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are your insides on fire?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They always are.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel that.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hope that wasn’t a terrible mistake.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me too.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it’s great. Let me ask you this: Are you prepared to bet your pants in a darts competition?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think I’ve ever played darts before.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not a no.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">June.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How about this: one more round and then we decide on pants darts.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">O-Okay.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Excellent. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Don’t let her bully you, okay?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I’m not... I feel really good. I’m celebrating, right?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Goddamnit.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">They use this juke box here, it’s so old. It was part of the Louisiana Purchase, it’s so old. Sometimes it breaks down and I have to mess with it. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From out of the bar’s sound system.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, it’s not solitude you seek, but friendship.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Under her breath.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Will you leave me alone?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Considering what we’ve all witnessed, I’m surprised you must ask anything of me.</p>
<p class="dialogue">With a wave of your hand, you could kill us all. That’s what you said, Clementine. So, wave your hand, then.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Annoying me all night isn’t going to get you anything.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I believe I shall stay, if it’s all the same to you.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do I have to break every speaker in this town?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You may certainly try, Clementine, but I’ve found with such modern day gadgetry out there, there seems to be a noisemaker in everything, doesn’t there?</p>

<p class="dialogue">... I’m trying to save people, don’t you understand that?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do not, Clementine. Because you refuse to explain yourself to us.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t owe you an explanation.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do not keep your motivations hidden, then charge the sky with thunder when you are misunderstood.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I am looking for understanding. As a thing that lives and breathes it is my obligation to understand another.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s more like it.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE WALKS BACK INTO THE BAR. WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE RAUCOUS CROWD AT THE SHEEP’S EYE. JUNE ADDRESSES THE CROWD.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once upon a time in ancient Greece, a guy picked up a ball and said “Hey. Try and stop me from getting over there.” And thus the sport of football was born. Today is no different from that day in ancient Greece, as we combine two of life’s great joys: the game of darts, and the thrill of someone losing their pants so that you can see their incredibly poor underwear choices. People of the Sheep’s Eye roadhouse, I give you: Pants Darts.</p>
<p class="direction">APPLAUSE.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The rules are simple: the winner keeps their pants. Some would say that it is currently too cold outside to risk one’s pants in a darts game, but they are forgetting our long tradition in this town of ignoring common sense.</p>
<p class="direction">LAUGHTER.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our contestants tonight are: The queen mum of pants darts, Me. Stepping up to the board in this inaugural game: Quolby Jack. Where’s Quolby Jack? There he his. John Pruitt is here tonight. Hello John. John is terrible at darts as we all know. This either means that John is a good sport or he really wants to show us his underwear. D. Fox is playing. That’s unfortunate for us all because if there’s anyone here who is freeballing tonight it is D. Fox. God help us all. Last but not least, the weirdest lady I’ve ever met in my life, which is really saying something in this town, it’s Clementine! Where is Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Talking to someone at the bar.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t understand, why is it called iced tea if there’s no iced tea in it?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, are you ready?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? Oh. Okay, yeah, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Love the enthusiasm. Okay, one more thing, gambling is wrong and we frown on it. However, CC Rider has fired up some side betting over in the corner. He’s taking bets on what style of underwear we are all wearing. I don’t approve but you degenerates need an outlet, so go nuts. Frank? Last chance, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely not.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>

<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not surprising. Okay, take these pointy things.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Throw the pointy things at the big circle. Try to hit the middle.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Which I wouldn’t do were our predicament not so dire, Clementine. Though, someone who invades the past lives of my compatriots and then cries for privacy is perhaps a bit too much for polite conversation to bear.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s what we’re doing? Having a polite conversation?</p>

<p class="dialogue">... And where are you from?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not doing this.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am from Arkansas. Was born in my parents’ bedroom in the year 1895, five years before the century’s turn.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t care.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">My father was a farmer at first, then after a strange turn of events, moved his talents to hog farming. Perhaps a more grim profession, but far more lucrative.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A strange turn of events?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Indeed. Torrential downfall one year. Unlike anything he’d seen. Good news for a farmer when a wet season proceeds the spring. And yet for some odd reason, his crops that year were poorly and he had hardly anything to take to market. That put him in dire straits. Not one to hesitate, he purchased two dozen hogs with his savings and that was that. “Hogs are hogs despite the rainfall.” He said. Those rains taught him a lesson, though. That a curse can be dressed as a blessing.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did he grow?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pole beans mostly. And sweet peas.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What the hell are you? I’ve never seen anything like you before. You... just show up in speakers?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s certainly an odd way to exist, but we each take the life we’re given.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that’s enough for you?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I were to travel down the path of solving the mystery of myself, how far down that trail could I go? How far could anyone go? The Lord has given us a great mystery by giving us this existence. Were we meant to unravel it? Perhaps being given this life is more akin to being given a musical instrument as a gift. You learn more, become more skilled as the years go by, but in a lifetime you could never master it.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t believe you think that’s an answer to my question.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you’re unsatisfied, just think how I feel. I do not know what I am, Clementine. I have come to think of it as... Imagine shouting your name into a canyon, and then after a moment, your voice comes back to you from the other side of the canyon. But the echo doesn’t stop there, it continues to travel down the canyon, saying your name over and over again. And then, in a strange moment, that echo of your voice somehow finds a voice of its own. It begins life as an echo of another but then comes to grow into a new being entirely, with thoughts and feelings independent of the one who once shouted it into existence in that canyon.</p>
