<p class="direction">THE LOW HUM OF FLUORESCENT LIGHTS. WE HEAR TERRIC HUMMING STELLA SPLENDENS TO HIMSELF.</p>
<p class="character">VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Asset 7, please step back from the door.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Speaking in an American accent now.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m nowhere near the door.</p>
<p class="direction">THERE IS A BUZZ AND THE DOOR TO THE HOLDING CELL OPENS. SOMEONE WALKS IN.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not the usual person who brings me lunch.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know... Where does it go? On this table?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fine.</p>
<p class="direction">TAMARA CROSSES TO THE TABLE AND SETS DOWN THE LUNCH TRAY. SHE SITS.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Well, come on. It’s going to get cold.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s usually cold when they serve it.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get your ass over here.</p>
<p class="direction">TERRIC CROSSES THE ROOM.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Taco Tuesday again already?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess so.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So who are you?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tamara.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice to meet you.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Isn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So, what do you do here? Are you the director or something?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t work here.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It’s hard to tell from inside this room, but I’m pretty sure this place is a secret government facility.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, it definitely is. Very hard to find.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... And you just walked in.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pretty much.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Once a week a nurse comes in and takes a blood sample, then a man comes in and questions me. That’s happened 50 times, which I think means I’ve been here about a year... Then you show up.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This must be a nice change of pace.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is. Also a strange one.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I knew some people.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">They must be pretty powerful people.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know if “powerful” is the word, but they’re the right people.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I suppose if I told you I was in here because of a massive case of mistaken identity that wouldn’t help.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not with me, it wouldn’t.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you know something other people don’t?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You know, I’m a very rich woman.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine so.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I didn’t come from money. I was a security guard at a mall when I was young. But one lucky break and several good investments later and now I’ve got my own plane.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me guess, it’s one of those Red Baron Planes, you wear a leather cap and goggles.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a G6. And for the past ten years I have been criss crossing the globe in it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is that?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because sometimes first class just won’t do it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean why have you been criss crossing the globe?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mind your business. So, the richer I got the more and more I was hanging around other rich people. And I don’t know if you know many rich people but, uh, “deeply strange” is the term I would use. At one point I’m on an island and I don’t even know what island I’m on. That’s a rich person thing, by the way, being on an island and not knowing where the hell you are. I’m in the lobby of a hotel looking out over the Mediterranean. And I’m surrounded by just an ungodly amount of these people. The GDP of Europe is in the lobby, okay? Anyway, I’m looking around and I’m thinking “What do they do? What do they do all day?” I’ve done very well for myself but, I guess it’s the poor kid in me, I still need something to do.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought that’s what charities and foundations were for.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t get me wrong, I give my fair share, but there’s only so many benefit galas a woman can go to.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">So how’d you fill your time?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">By looking for a man... Not like that.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A very elusive man.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s his name?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s part of the problem. He’s got a lot of them.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s confusing, he should pick one.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, he did. Many times... Tallon Lawson, Patrick Jenkins, Tom Webster, That’s just in the last 30 years.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not all that unusual, though. People on the run, criminals, they have multiple identities all the time. You know the right people, you can be anyone you want. It starts to get weird after going back 30 years.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tamara, let me stop you right there.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I’m just getting started.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been trapped here, in a government building, extrajudicially.</p>
<p class="dialogue">All the evidence you’re about to present to me, I’ve heard it all before. Once a week at least someone comes in here and presents me with the same evidence you’re about to present me with, and then I say back to them: “You’re insane.” Because it is insane. Accusing me of being a man that is somehow hundreds of years old? This is lunacy, and I think they know it now, and I think the only reason I’m still here is because of the size of the lawsuit I am going to bring as soon as they let me call a lawyer.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I see... so we’re still keeping up the facade, then?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you know what this place is?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but I like to imagine it somehow being hidden under Disneyland.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not hidden under Disneyland, it’s in a Business Park in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re the first person to tell me where I am.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I probably wasn’t supposed to do that, but I don’t give a shit... They call you an asset.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I know. I don’t know why.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They call you an asset because that’s what this place is... You’re not the only one they’re keeping here. There are others like you just down the hall, I saw them as I was escorted here.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Others like me?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not exactly like you. You’re Asset 7. Assets one through six are in the same building. I tried to get the guard to talk to me about it.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apparently one of them can suck the life out of a battery in ten minutes. Another one has a uh, “Casual relationship with gravity.” Whatever that means. They went through all the trouble to set this place up and you’re telling me that it was all a mistake on their part?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s exactly what I’m telling you.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you know why I’ve been criss-crossing the world in my fancy plane for ten years?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought it was none of my business.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been looking for you. I hired historians, I paid off local officials, I went to Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan! There’s nothing in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re right, there’s nothing there. Including me.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I do all that. Ten years of work. And that brings me to this government facility. And after all that you’re just going to tell me it’s all bullshit?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ten years and then you come in here and don’t even ask me my name?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know your name.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then what do you even need me for? You know everything.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I want to hear you say it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is ridiculous... So they just... they just let you in here? How is that even possible?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I see you’ve got two tactics in a situation like this: 1) Get the other person to talk about themself as much as you can and 2) Lie big and lie long...</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stick to your story and they’ll eventually give up on theirs. Their version of your story is harder to believe in anyway, right?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m surrounded by crazy people.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is your own damn fault, you know? You were the one who tipped me off.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You started getting a little squirrelly with your name choices in the 19th century. Maybe going a little crazy? Maybe wanting to get caught just a little bit? I mean it had been around 600 years at that point. Jay Snoozeton? You really expect people to believe that bullshit name?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the real cry for help was at the turn of the century. A man applies for Irish citizenship: Terry O’York?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’ve heard this all before and I’ll say the same thing I did then-</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How about The Demon of Breitenfeld?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That wasn’t your official name. Just the name that they gave you... We had to dig deep for that one, I’m betting they haven’t thrown that name at you yet... I’m sorry I had to bring it up, you probably didn’t want to hear that right now...</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What if I could get you out of here?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m too rich to repeat myself, don’t make me.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You can’t.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’ll take more than an impressive bank account to get me out of here.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got more than that.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also they’re listening to this conversation right now and you just proposed an escape.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re not listening.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course they’re listening.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, they’re not. They’re not listening because I used my impressive bank account to get a private conversation. See how that works?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">...How?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then where would we...</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got a place we can go.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re serious, aren’t you?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am very serious.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What’s in this for you?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me? Oh it’s been a lifelong journey for me. I need some closure. It all started a long time ago... when I met a strange woman named Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine it began about the same way for you.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Tell me what you know.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have a lot to talk about.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We do.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Get me the fuck out of here, then.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">One condition.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s your name?... Your real name.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Slipping into his English accent.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">...My name is Terric of York. Son of Tybalt the First. I was born in Castle Pontefract in the year of our lord 1371.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I found you, motherfucker.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Back to an American accent.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes you did.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This has been a long time coming, Terric.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me getting out of here has also been a long time coming, so what’s the plan?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">As I’m sure you can imagine, I’ve led a rather extraordinary life, I doubt you can surprise me.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. It’s been a surprising day so far.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Try me.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well. First of all. Those tacos I brought you did not come from the commissary.</p>
<p class="direction">WE SUDDENLY HEAR THE DEAFENING SOUND OF THE LASER SAW CUTTING THROUGH CONCRETE.</p>

<p class="character">TAMARA</p>

<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what the fuck is that?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we should probably just wait until I can explain everything at once.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have been informed that there are many people here who are being held against their will.</p>

<p class="dialogue">They explained this to me earlier today. Apparently they’ve done a jail break or two.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who explained it to you?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A jail break comes in three parts apparently: insertion, distraction, extraction. I’m the insertion, that’s the distraction, and now...</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tamara got it. It’s cool right? Apparently it’s called “Reaper”. Rich people are wild. She said she wanted a helicopter, made one phone call and then a helicopter showed up. Everybody in?</p>

<p class="dialogue">So, it was the craziest thing. I’m bopping all around the globe looking for you for ten years and then I finally find you in Lincoln-Goddamn-Nebraska and I can’t get to you because you’re locked away in a black site. I’m staying at the Hilton trying to calculate my next move. By the way, The Lincoln, Nebraska Hilton? Not recommended. So, I’ve reached a point in my life where I really REALLY hate not getting what I want. And as I’m looking out the window, that’s when I see it. Like God’s own love.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oooh. Floor is Lava. Been a while.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A little something from the pre-Ava days. Leif and I had a few set ways of getting out of a jam.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, there was “Floor is Lava.” There was also “That’s my Wombat.”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also, “Here Comes Cardinal Richelieu.”</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="dialogue">No, actually. Sometimes it can be downright depressing. We went through a rough patch a few weeks ago and we’re starting to turn it around now.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happened a few weeks ago?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

But I’m here to tell you that you, Mr. Seven Hundred Year Old Man, are just a very small part of a much, MUCH weirder universe. So, I told you my story, now why don’t you tell me yours?

<p class="dialogue">Seriously?</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God, that’s so sad!</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was devastated.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She just disappeared on you, huh?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was ready to give up everything. Forgive anything. And then she was gone.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That even makes me sad, Terric, and I hate love stories.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">My time with her was the happiest I’ve ever been. And the most confused. But the confusion then was nothing compared to the confusion that followed.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because Caspar sent you a little message.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was the start of it, yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I just say, he did not tell me he was going to do that and I feel like there was a better version of that plan.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did the message say?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">The paper it was written on fully disintegrated about 400 years ago. But it went like this: Dear Terric of York. I apologize in advance for saying a bunch of things you’re not going to understand, but I’m writing you this note because I think you may be looking for Clementine. If you are, I should tell you that we are too. We are Midnight Burger, a time traveling, dimension-spanning diner. If you try really hard, you might find us. But we’ll probably find you first. Until then, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that’s not helpful at all.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I desperately want you to imagine what it’s like for a man living in 14th century Jerusalem to receive a note like that.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Damn.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Added to that, the note was delivered by... Something?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was a friend of ours, we’ll explain later. Keep going, though.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, after the whole experience, I felt like I was waking up from a dream. I wondered if it had even happened. Things began to calm down, I went back to my studies. And then... I began to notice the change. Or the lack of it. My friend, Yosef began to get gray hair... I did not. He became a grandparent. There were fruit sellers in the market, they began to be taken over by their children. Holes in the great wall around the old city were repaired. And nothing changed for me. I was exactly as you see me now. At a certain point I had to make the choice to leave. Jerusalem was full of suspicion back then. In the City of God people are always on the lookout for the devil. I began to get some worried looks. So one day I packed up my things and I moved on. And that became a pattern for me for... for the rest of my very long life.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel ridiculous asking this question, considering where we are but, how did you become this?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been asking myself that question for about seven hundred years.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric, when you were with Clementine did you ever talk about wanting to live a long time or wanting to see what the world would be like in the future?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I practiced Alchemy at the time. I do remember telling her about the elixir of life, something that alchemists tried to pull off. A magical potion that would give you immortality.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what did it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what did it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He mentioned immortality one time and suddenly he lives forever?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine is incredibly powerful, Terric. She’s the most powerful thing we’ve encountered and we’ve seen some shit. She does things accidentally. Subconsciously. You talked about something important to you and then she gave it to you without even meaning to.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, I’m just talking out my ass here, but there may have been something else going on.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She said she loved you, Terric. And you loved her, right?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think she stuck a pin in you.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s on a mission. That much is clear. Maybe deep down she knew she was going to have to figure some shit out. She knew she was going to have to go. But she also loved you so she...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shoved you in a pickle jar and put you in a shady spot.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">A pickle jar.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe subconsciously she wanted to make sure she could always come back to you. No matter what.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m not convinced of the science parts of this plan.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry about it... Last time we did this we were on a planet called Rudra. The whole planet was under the control of a weird cult leader named Kyle of Light and his wife Sunny D. Anomaly. It took them about five minutes to identify us as some sort of demonic presence.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That tends to happen when you suddenly materialize in the town square.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Believe it or not, it wasn’t because we suddenly appeared out of nowhere, it was because we served meat. They were all vegan. Anyway, the people of Rudra, not unlike our friends from Homeland Security, were pretty dumb, so Floor is Lava went off pretty well.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You had little schemes with fun names. You didn’t do any of that around me.</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And look, I’m describing it as fun but... I only knew that after the fact. I only know that now. Back then my biggest objective was to be miserable so I never noticed that it was fun. Nobody ever tells you you’re having the time of your life, you only realize that after it’s over.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I showed up and ended the time of your life.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, look, it was pretty infantile when it was me and Leif, okay? You showed up and you had ideas about the diner, and physics, and time and space and all that garbage.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re making me sound like a party pooper.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not at all a party pooper. But honestly, sometimes the party needs to be pooped. And sometimes there’s no one around to poop the party that is desperately in need of pooping. It was an improvement. Even though you would do things like throw rocks at me and call me a bed wetter, it got more grown up. I liked it.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve got a lot of reasons to be upset with Clementine... a lot. But I think the last time we went up against her we may have knocked some sense into her. And I think if the reality of her situation is about to crash down on her, it’s going to be rough. And considering how little control she has over her emotions and her power, it could be fucking disastrous. Her emotional breakdown could mean a breakdown of reality, people could get hurt... they have been already.</p>

It’s been strange, and confusing, sometimes wonderful, and... and terrifying... And you’re telling me that she... she could’ve shown up at any time, through all that and... and she just didn’t... I wouldn’t be able to do that to someone I care about. Which must mean...</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric, when I said that she stuck a pin in you, that’s all subconscious. She doesn’t know that she did this to you, as far as she knows you lived and died in Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well, she could’ve come back to me then. She didn’t. She left and never came back and you think that I’m going to have some sort of... That I’m going to be able to fix things somehow. She may not not even remember me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric it’s been seven hundred years for you, not for her. But, I get it. You can’t imagine treating someone this way, not someone you truly love. We want people to love us the same way we love them... you wanted her to stay and she didn’t. She left you. And the easiest thing to say is that she never loved or cared about you at all. And you feel that way because you would never do that to her. You’d never leave her.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wouldn’t.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t hold her to that. Because she’s not you. Everybody’s different and everybody loves differently. It’s hard to understand that about people, but you can’t demand that people act like you.</p>

<p class="dialogue">She wrote you a letter saying she was turning into a monster. She couldn’t let you see that.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What is the hard part?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi there, Terric. Here’s how this works: Clementine, just by being around, damages the fabric of space/time, and that damage manifests itself in all sorts of ways, like a mall full of zombies or asteroids that can only be seen by half the people on Earth.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait. You’re saying Ashley the Asteroid was because of her?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you see it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I saw it, did you see it?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. That was her, Terric.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Without going too much into it, Ashley the Asteroid was just a by-product of something much bigger. And she did all of that completely by accident. She had a conversation with two astrophysicists in a pub in London and then, suddenly in the sky, was an asteroid.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our current understanding is that we see this damage to space/time a lot, but Clementine’s different because she’s not just a victim of the damage but can also spread the damage. Caspar had a good analogy for this: Typhoid Mary.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I remember those days, that’s why I left New York.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What we’ve also come to understand is that this diner, this ridiculous, should-not-exist place... It somehow heals the damage. And some of that damage is in you, Terric. That damage is what made you a seven hundred year old man.</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you stay with us while we wait for Clementine, the diner is going to fix that damage. If you stay here long enough, when you go back out there into whatever world you choose, you will probably start to age again for the first time in a very long time.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see... to die.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. To die.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a big decision, Terric.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just real quick, have we confirmed that once the diner heals him the years aren’t going to suddenly rush at him and turn him to dust?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, that’s not going to happen.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do we know?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because that would be stupid.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You’re not allowed to say science, nobody said you could say science.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hi, Terric.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening right now?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. There’s a couple of southern baptist ministers inside the radio and they talk to you sometimes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Sure.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">This may seem at bit self-serving at first Terric, but I wish to frame your predicament in a certain light. So do bear with us.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Self-serving how?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Can you tell me of Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh... It was a wonderful place. Probably the last place I felt truly at home. Back then it was controlled by the Mamluks. Egyptians. I can’t say that they returned the city to it’s former glory but they did revive a tradition of sharing that Saladin brought in when he took the city back from the Christians.</p>
<p class="dialogue">All faiths there were very separate but they did manage to find a way to share the city, to worship separately but also side by side... The image of the Tower of David framed by the sunset. I’ve kept that with me for seven centuries.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a dream of mine to go there one day. To walk the same path as Jesus, and all the others. I admit I’m a bit envious of your memories.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought about returning from time to time but, it wouldn’t be the same. Not without her.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, quick update, y’all. Terric and Clementine were a thing.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like a THING thing?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You sound surprised.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Surprised you survived.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric, a while back, we met someone. A fugitive whose homeland had been destroyed. They stayed with us until a more suitable home could be found.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They were a tree.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">A tree. Their name was Shel.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Alright.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shel was always listening and learning from us. And from time to time had insight into our lives that would belie their youth. They once described all of us as fugitives like they were, but in a deeper, more spiritual sense.</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can all recall a time when our lives seemed in harmony with the holy spirit, a time when our lives seemed to keep pace with the sun and there was a blessed synchronicity in all things. And then we can all recall that time ending. We each have our own Garden of Eden, and are, all of us, cast out from it. And we spend the rest of our time on Earth trying to somehow return to that place, and that journey back becomes a life in full. Perhaps, just perhaps, the gates are beginning to swing wide on your Garden of Eden, Terric. Perhaps our presence here is that very rare call to come back home.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine if I saw Jerusalem or Clementine again, it wouldn’t be the same. So much has changed. It wouldn’t feel like coming back home.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I imagine you were able to get a bit of reading done over the centuries, Terric.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I was.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>

<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh. I see. “And the end of all our exploring, will be to arrive where we started.”</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And to know that place for the first time.”</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There’s this embarrassing part of myself that I’ve never been able to shake. Over the centuries I’ve become cynical about so many things, and yet... Somewhere deep down is still that Medieval romantic... That part of me that would give anything just to see her face again.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s nothing to be embarrassed about, Terric. We’re all a bunch of cynics here. It’s a breath of fresh air to hear someone just say what they’re feeling without any of the nonsense that’s usually wrapped around it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Enchiladas on the counter, everybody... So? What’s it going to be, Terric?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Caspar, why did you send me that message? What did you expect me do?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok look. We’ve got 12 hours every time we stop and we have to make decisions on the fly, sometimes we don’t make the best decisions.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes I don’t make the best decisions. I was winging it... I don’t know... At first I was wondering if you were another Clementine, that there were two of her out there. But then I thought... what if you were just a guy? Just a guy in Medieval Jerusalem who stumbled into Clementine one day and then all of a sudden had no expiration date? What if he’s wandering out there, confused. What if he feels alone? What if he feels the years piling up on him? What if it’s driving him crazy? I have some experience with this. Human beings aren’t built for a lot of years like that. I... I wondered if you needed a hand. I wondered if maybe you wanted off the merry-go-round.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>

Seeing as how there’s an unclassified heavy weapon on the roof, the ground can be randomly electrified, and there’s a man who is older than steam powered locomotion sitting at this booth. So, I guess I’m kind of winging it.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m surprised you haven’t called for backup yet. Where’s the rest of Homeland Security?</p>
<p class="character">AGENT MURPHY</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a problem. There’s only three people in the government who know our facility actually exists. The President, The Director, and for some reason a very rich man in The UAE? That makes calling for backup a little difficult... which is, of course, something I shouldn’t have told you. Have I mentioned I’ve never negotiated before?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me start off the negotiations. We’re not giving up Terric and none of us are leaving this diner.</p>
<p class="character">AGENT MURPHY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. You’re just going to stay here?</p>

<p class="character">AGENT MURPHY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, what do you plan on doing with Terric?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>

<p class="character">TAMARA</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry about it. Sara, listen. We didn’t bring you in here to negotiate, we brought you in here because we felt a little bad. I think you’re out of your element a little, don’t you?</p>
<p class="character">AGENT MURPHY</p>
