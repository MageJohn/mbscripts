<p class="direction">THE SOUND OF GLORIA SCRUBBING THE GRILL.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You want me to do that?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I need to do it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So Leif and Ava are still upstairs.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What do you think they’re talking about?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even if we knew what they were talking about we wouldn’t know what they were talking about.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">True.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I sent them up there with the radio. I told them not to talk to me until the Mucklewains can understand what they’re talking about. They’re going to be a while.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not a bad idea... So I was gone when you declared war on an intergalactic empire.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We missed you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I get the feeling that when you made that decision, you acted a little like this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like what?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Focused. Focused Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, sure.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And now you’ve decided we’re going after Clementine and you’re very grill focused.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava has a booth, Leif has a roof, I have a grill. What do you have?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, I keep trying to talk to you about a pinball machine.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Find something else.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ski ball?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure this is the right move?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, that asteroid yesterday? It may not have even been there until she talked to two people a a bar about asteroids. She got the word “asteroid” in her head, and then accidentally made one. Somebody’s got to do something and there’s nobody else who can. What do you want me to do? Call Jean Claude Van Damme Time Cop?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not saying you should call Jean Claude Van Damme Time Cop, I’m asking if we should be going after this woman without knowing exactly what she’s capable of. According to Ava she made two universes collide.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well maybe that’s easier than it sounds.</p>
<p class="direction">THE BACKDOOR SWINGS OPEN.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re out of your mind.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">YOU’RE out of YOU’RE mind.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, she’s out of her mind.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on, hang on. Am I going to understand this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Mucklewains can officially understand what we’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we hate it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You did not say the Mucklewains needed to like it, you said they needed to understand it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, fine. Let’s hear it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She wants to make wind chimes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You remember our friends The Teds. Remember how they trapped us using a very dangerous experiment with Time Crystals?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava wants to do the same thing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s some kind of relationship between Clementine and the damage to the fabric of space time that we’ve been seeing. I don’t know what it is, though.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">By the way, can we come up with a term for the damage to the fabric of space time? I feel like there should be a term for it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve seen the diner be able to fix the damage. The shopzies were all trapped inside the diner and they were fixed.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not calling them that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But yesterday I pulled a whole bunch of the meteor people in here and they were still seeing the meteor.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Because in that situation you would have to put literally every person on Earth in the diner for the diner to heal the damage to the fabric of space time.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that true?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who knows? ANYWAY. Theoretically if we can keep Clementine here for a while, we may be able to throw water on the witch, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She can vanish any time she wants, she’s a little hard to keep here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you see where she’s going with this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We zip around through space and time as well. And what did the Teds do to us?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trapped us in three galaxies.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want to trap her in three galaxies?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I want to trap her here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow, I really hate this idea.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The thing The Teds built was huge. We can’t build something like that.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We wouldn’t need to. I suspect the Teds’ wind chimes were so big because of scale. They needed to cast a wide net. We don’t need to cast a wide net, we just need her to stay either in here or in the parking lot long enough for the diner to zap her.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then what? You put her on a slab and dissect her?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Preferably.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what is the problem with this plan?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, firstly we would be using the tools of our enemy to do our good work.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And another, I don’t want this woman within 5 miles of these front doors.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And my thing is, it’s impossible to make and also incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not impossible to make.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it incredibly dangerous?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It may be incredibly dangerous but it’s not hard to make.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really? Because before we make a time crystal we’re going to have to make a quantum computer FROM SCRATCH.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Putting photons in a superposition is not hard.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s not hard. Producing entanglement is hard.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m hearing a lot of “can’t” from you.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Single photon emitter, beam splitter, camera detector, KLM protocol, you want me to keep going?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eye of newt?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also NMR isn’t going to do it so you’re going to have to trap ions. Are you going to fabricate components and make a dedicated dilution refrigerator? Are you going to put everything in a vacuum chamber to contain the noise?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Will you be inside the vacuum chamber?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, and, by the way, everything will have to be kept just slightly above absolute zero so it’ll need comprehensive environmental controls.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you need comprehensive environmental controls.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s a shame you can’t do it, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No reverse psychology!... Of course I can do it. But if I’m just salvaging from whatever Earth we land on, it’s going to take a while before I have everything we need. This is a long list.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s the only option we have right now so work as fast as you can.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Fine. Just one final warning. Working with time crystals, like we’re about to, it’s banned in The Triad for a reason. Experiments like this once turned an entire planet into a black hole. I’m sure we don’t want an artificially created black hole to suddenly spring up in the diner.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure most of us don’t want an artificially created black hole to suddenly spring up in the diner.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again, it’s the only option we have. If you come up with something else, let me know. Effie, where are we going?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I detect a great gateway, Gloria. And great beginnings.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here comes the boom.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DINER SETS DOWN ON SOLID GROUND AND WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A BIG MUSICAL THUD COMING FROM THE FRONT OF THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was that?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did that come from the front?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... Come out here.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How...</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, that appears to be a piano in the middle of the dining room.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where did it come from?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Y’all are we going to have to start looking out for pianos falling on us now?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we not enduring enough?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had to endure all sorts of things through the years but there was never a sudden piano.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hmm.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, can anyone play the piano?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava can.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you know that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You told me.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">When did you learn to play the piano?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I was a kid.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, so you can play Jingle Bells or whatever.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I can play more than that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How much can you play?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Why did I tell you that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, I had no idea you were a musician, that’s awful nice.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not. I’m not a musician. I can play the piano, okay?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is this making you so uncomfortable?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because everyone’s looking at me and not looking at the sudden piano. Isn’t the sudden piano weirder than me being able to play it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You being able to play the piano is somehow weirder that one appearing out of thin air.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think that just makes you the weird one.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s still you.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, whatever. There’s a piano here. Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Play something on the piano.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">C’mon.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t say c’mon to me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What kind of piano player were you?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are kinds?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, like, Jazz or were you one of those genius kids you played the moonlight sonata when the were 4?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I took piano lessons, I play the piano, can we stop talking about it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just play a short thing.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would love to hear Ava play the piano.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would too dear, if only because it appears to upset her very much.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not playing the piano.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">C’mon.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think this is going to stop until you play something.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How else are we really going to know?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you know any Warren Zevon?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Me too, what’s going on?</p>

Here we are, the sun is setting, and we show up in places at all times of day but we say “we open at 6”. Which we hardly ever do, so I don’t know where that came from. Then I remember I was here for about a lifetime before you showed up so... probably me?... Ava what’s wrong, why did you get mad at a sudden piano?... Okay... Oh hey, that’s the Gateway Arch, we’re in St. Louis... Oh, we’re in St. Louis... Where you are from.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Look this is hard stuff. She’s a single mom, you’re a workaholic, not to mention the fact that it’s the mid 70s and there’s very few places you two can go and feel comfortable. Jimmy Swaggart’s out there right now on television, calling people sexual deviants, but trust me in a few years that’s going to play out in a very hilarious way.</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, you just sit down at people’s booths and start poking into their lives?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not all the time.</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I appreciate you all being cool with us and not looking at us funny but it’s not about what happens in safe places. I have the right to hold your hand in public, I have the right to kiss you in public, and I’m ready to fight anybody who’s got problems. You’re not.</p>
<p class="character">MILLY</p>

<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">MILLY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hate how hard this is.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. Relationships are hard. There’s nothing more complicated than two people who love each other in a relationship. Two people in a relationship who hate each other is actually super simple. You wake up in the morning “Hey, we hate each other. Cool, I’m off to work.”</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, all the time.</p>
<p class="character">MILLY</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I was such an idiot when I met her... I would push my stroller past her house all the time. There was this one house with a huge garden in the front yard, which was already weird, but there was a sign in the yard that said “Maggie’s Yarm.” And I would always wonder what the hell it meant. Then one day I saw her in the yard and we started talking.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Yard Farm.”</p>
<p class="character">MILLY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Because she really wanted a farm but could only afford a yard... I remember rolling the stroller away after the first time we talked and just thinking... “God damn I want to buy you that farm so bad.” Took me months to realize why I was feeling that way.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you ever tell her that?</p>
<p class="character">MILLY</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh Man, Effie what are you guys on this time?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does anyone remember the northeast blackout of 1965? I was just a kid here in Saint Louis so I don’t remember it but these outages we keep having got me thinking about when the things we depend on fail us. It was 1965 and around 30 million people in the northeast lost power for 13 hours. From New York all the way up to Toronto. How about those numbers? I wonder how many people had to stay trapped in an elevator for 13 hours, can you imagine? You know what’s funny about this, is the whole northeast lost power but somehow in Maine, the lights stayed on the whole time. Now, I’m not up for conspiracies because I’m a grown woman, but I was thinking. Wouldn’t it be funny if Maine was behind the whole thing... what if something that seems like an interesting little glitch was actually the plan of someone or something you would never expect... Just a thought.</p>

<p class="dialogue">A long time ago... The boys... had just come home from the war... It was back then.</p>

<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, fine.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you should get back in there and work things out, I think you owe it to yourself.</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because, shot in the dark here, you are so proud of your self sufficiency that it’s hard for you to factor anyone else into the equation.</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Maybe.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that’s admirable. Maybe it makes you a little hard to be around.</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s not exactly easy to be around either.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I know.</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was so closeted when I met her. She wasn’t even out to herself. She was just REALLY interested in my life and REALLY wanted to hang out. The first time I came over to her house she invited me for dinner and forgot to buy food. There was a moldy loaf of bread in the pantry, that’s it. I called her Moldy Bread Milly for months after that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">God, that’s where it came from.</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing. Look, I know. She can be a big mess sometimes. She’s got a two year-old kid, she’s a single mom, she works at a gas station.</p>

<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Were you fine?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely not, Maggie.</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was hard, okay? I was a little kid, in the midwest, with two moms, in the 80-... a long time ago. Kids made fun of me sometimes. The cruelty of children to other children is its own category of evil. They tried to go to a PTA meeting and people protested and wrote letters. They were asked to not come back. Then one time, one of them had something wrong with their gallbladder or some shit and she had to go to the emergency room, but Mom number two wasn’t allowed in the emergency room because she wasn’t a member of the family, so I had to constantly run back and forth from the emergency room to the waiting room trying to keep both of them calm and I was eight?!</p>
<p class="character">MAGGIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry about all that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s okay. I’m fine.</p>

It speaks to me. It stretches out in front of me, it all fits together, I can visualize all of it. It’s like magic... So I was good at music, but it wasn’t enough for me, and she hated that. She wouldn’t put me in any advanced programs, she wouldn’t let me do the Mathlympics at school, which I would’ve crushed at... I’d have to go with her to her gigs and she’d find me at the end of the night doing the manager’s books.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You thought bringing them out into the parking lot would do something?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t even know at this point. I’d try electroshock therapy if I thought it would work.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I guess we just wait for them to come back but this music is driving me crazy.</p>
<p class="direction">RADIO BUZZES.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sweet freedom!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There we go.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria! It is not unlike the halls of Nebuchadnezzar! Are there sorceresses about?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorceresses?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, we are being snared in some sort of a deadfall!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything seems to be going okay, y’all.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that is the whole point of a trap, isn’t it? If it felt like a trap, nobody would wander into it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the madness of Queen Jezebel!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, Zeb. Calm down.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are they talking about?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They think we’re in a trap.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trust me, I know what it feels like to be trapped in Saint Louis, this isn’t a trap.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is possible this is all just a coincidence.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">If it was all on purpose that would mean... I mean if we’re talking about Clementine, that would mean that she can control where we go. She can’t control where we go.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if she could, why would she send us to Saint Louis to have a nice time.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on... Thinking like a criminal for a second... It might make a little sense.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... If I was going to threaten someone, first they would need to know that I can follow through with the threat. So... I’d show off a little.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s it exactly, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is the Staff of the Pharaoh cast upon the ground.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we ease up on the severity, everyone?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re going to need a little more evidence.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, let’s take it easy, let’s talk about a problem when we have a problem.</p>
<p class="direction">THE AIR BECOMES DISTURBED AROUND THEM.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria... We’ve got a problem.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE MATERIALIZES IN THE PARKING LOT.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi everyone. How was mother’s day?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everybody stand back.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I got about 12 hours of curses built up for you, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was the meaning of all this, Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everybody relax. I’m not going to rain down hellfire on you. Yet.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So this was you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just a little fun. I just needed to show you what I was capable of.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what are we supposed to do with that?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just listen.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, you listen to me. You turned a mall full of people into monsters, you made an asteroid appear out of nowhere. Whatever you’re doing, you need to stop it.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a lot of strange things out there, Gloria. How can you be sure it was me?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re sure it was you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are infinite timelines out there and you people are concerned about a mall?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A mall and an entire planet, yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not to mention whatever else you’ve done.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I haven’t done anything! ...I have had things done to me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which gives you the right to what exactly?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Rights? What are you talking about, Gloria? Are you still talking about your plan? Everyone’s got to stick to Gloria’s plan, right?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re hurting people.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t know that. How could you even tell? People are getting hurt every second of every hour of every day, how can you tell the difference between the pain that comes from me or the pain that comes from, I don’t know, the universe being full of hurt! ...I know you’ve all seen it. World after world after world of hurt and pain and loss. And you want to stop me? Because that’ll stop what? People from being hurt?... Oh wait... I get it now... you people have decided that you’re a little band of do-gooders, is that it? Zig-zagging around the stars righting wrongs? Ridiculous... I’m sure Zebulon has convinced you all that I’m some sort of lost little lamb, right? An injured little doe in the woods. A misguided little kid... You’re the ones who are fooling yourselves. There’s no order to things. There are no laws written in the stars... There’s only one thing that rings true to me: I have the power to get what I want. So I’m going to get it.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Despite what that may take from others?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t talk to me about what I take! ...I could snap my fingers and kill you all... But I’m not here to do that. I’m not here to take anything... I’m here to give you something.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not interested.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course you are. I know because you’ve all told me exactly what you’re interested in... And I can give it all to you. I’ve shown you here today. I put you in a world where Ava’s mom and Caspar’s moms all live in Saint Louis. I put you here. I can put you anywhere I want, hell I can put a piano in your dining room... So I’m not here with threats... I’m here with what you want. A world where Leif didn’t throw everything away, a world where every scientist in the world listens to Dr. Ava Maddox... I can give you your son back, Caspar. You deserve to have him back. You’ve suffered enough. You should meet him again... I have.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s enough.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you, Gloria, well it could go one of two ways for you. Which will it be? A world where a virus from across the sea didn’t take your dream from you or shall we go deeper? Should we say a world where, one night, your parents cruised right through that intersection and there was no drunk driver to be found?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is evil, what you’re doing, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d make an offer to Effie and Zebulon but they already have what they want: to be considered human by all of you.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not interested-</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No no no. No. You’re not supposed to answer me right now, Gloria. You have to sit with it a while. You have to let it eat away at you. Like I have. You have to sit there and let a better life look you in the eye while all you have to do is say yes...</p>
<p class="direction">THE AIR BEGINS TO CHANGE AROUND THEM.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to put you somewhere for a while. Give you some time to think. I’ll come and get you when I feel like you’re ready. I recommend you all figure out how to say yes to me... You don’t want to see the alternative.</p>
