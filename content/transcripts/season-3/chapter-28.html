<p class="direction">A RADIO CLICKS ON AND GOES BACK AND FOURTH THROUGH THE DIAL SEARCHING FOR A STATION. FINALLY A VOICE COMES THROUGH.</p>
<p class="character">RADIO REPORTER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cathode Ray Tube Televisions, or CRT Televisons, or as my grandma called them “Bunny Ear Televisions” were all but extinct a year ago, but these days they may be the most prized possession in the world. When the first solar storm hit 8 months ago, everyone’s big beautiful flat screen televisions went dark when the complicated technology inside them was scrambled by the sun’s magnetic bombardment. The world suddenly went silent and television, in a instant, became a thing of the past. But in the past few months, things began to change. Breaking News America, a formerly fourth rate cable news station announced that they would begin broadcasting their usual nightly news show “Past Prologue”. Using broadcasting methods from the early days of live television, BNA said that it would be able to provide a nightly, live news update to anyone who could get their hands on a Cathode Ray Tube television. Within days, thrift stores and vintage shops were completely cleared out of any CRT televisions. People seemed to be dying for at least something that reminded them of the world they lost 8 months ago. Now, as the world anxiously awaits the results of the “Hong Kong Experiment”, watch parties have sprung up all over the city with large groups of people gathered around whatever Bunny Ear TV they can find.</p>

<p class="direction">THERE’S A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come in.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR OPENS.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey... Vinyl still works.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I always warned you about all your stuff being digital.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And look at me now.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Turns out all the things that made me intolerable, like collecting huge amounts of Vinyl, are now paying off.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe not all the things.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any word on Hong Kong?</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine I would say if I knew anything. It is the most important news in the world right now.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Are Jeff and the kids still upstate?</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. The kids are still pretty freaked out. They started volunteering at a shelter up there, that’s giving them some structure, but he has a hard time getting them to go to sleep at night.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you tried Bourbon?</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re 7 and 9 years old.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t see how that’s relevant.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway. They’ll be fine. Better up there than in the city. In ANY city these days. How are things on Park Avenue?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Turns out I was the only one living on Park Avenue who didn’t buy a place upstate. It’s a ghost town over there, everyone’s gone. I walk the streets like Omega Man.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a little disturbing to me how well you’ve fared in this particular apocalypse we find ourselves in.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we’ve both fared pretty well.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you’ve liked it just a little bit.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Siobhan, planes were falling from the sky.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not that part. The other parts. The “vinyl still works” parts.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were about to go extinct, you and I. We were talking heads on television, nobody cared about talking heads on television anymore. But then this new dark age hit and... we’re suddenly useful. It’s a strange feeling, I never thought I’d be useful again. Have you heard about these watch parties? People gathered around antique televisions every night?</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I heard.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">People went all-in on the internet, then the internet disappeared. Who do they turn to? A couple of dinosaurs like us.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t call me a dinosaur.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re dinosaurs, Siobhan. But it is very suddenly the time of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="direction">A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tania, what’s the word?</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hong Kong failed. We’re on in two minutes.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Agreed. Let’s go.</p>
<p class="direction">ALL THREE OF THEM WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY. WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A BUSY TELEVISION STUDIO.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We still don’t have the prompter up and running so you’re going to have to wing it.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fine.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Getting used to it at this point.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s bullet points on the desk. You go through the bullet points and then you’re going to go live to the capitol, apparently the senate is going to vote on another aid package.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s at the capitol?</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Amanda Marie and Daniel. We’ve got the earpieces up and running again, so both of you be prepared to have me in your ear for the rest of the night.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long are we going to go with this?</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Giving them the bad news will take about two minutes, we’re going to broadcast until I feel like people have calmed down a little bit. It’ll take as long as it takes.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Got it.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get to places, I’m getting the control room set up.</p>
<p class="direction">TANIA WALKS THROUGH A DOOR INTO THE CONTROL ROOM. THE ROOM IS BUSY WITH TECHNICIANS. DANIEL IS ON THE PHONE.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re called Image Orthocon Tubes. If I can get enough of those, I don’t need the physical camera, I can make the camera myself... Okay, call me back, I’m in the control room.</p>
<p class="direction">HE HANGS UP.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that about?</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Spare parts. These cameras are going to fold on us any time, I’m trying to get backups.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did we try the Film and Television museum?</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where do you think I got our current ones from? I’m talking to guys at junkyards now.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is Amanda Marie in my headset yet?</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not the greatest signal but it’ll work.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Amanda Marie are you there?</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In headset.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m here. We’re going to have to broadcast from the capitol steps, these old cameras don’t travel well.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fine.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In headset.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">On the plus side we’re the only TV news team in existence now so we don’t have to fight for a good shot.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, hang tight, we’re going to throw things to you in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tania, Ryan’s on the phone for you.</p>
<p class="direction">TANIA PICKS UP THE PHONE.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s up, Ryan... uh-huh... seriously? You’re kidding me. Shit, that is hilarious. Okay, be ready when I throw to you.</p>
<p class="direction">SHE HANGS UP THE PHONE.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone, listen up for a second...</p>
<p class="direction">THE ROOM QUIETS DOWN.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are about to, once again, go on the air and report some bad news. I know we all wanted good news today but there’s nothing we can do about that. Focus on the job right in front of you, get to the end of the day, then do it again tomorrow, okay? I know it’s a tough world out there but at least we’re a useful part of it. Tom, Siobhan, you two ready?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re ready.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">One minute, people. (Into her headset.) Want to hear something ridiculous?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course we do.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re doing a weather report tonight.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re kidding.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ryan has a copy of the Farmer’s Almanac and the phone number of every meteorologist in the Tri-state area and he is just going to dive in.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is fucking ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, we’re here to do the news, right? Fifteen seconds.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THOMAS AND SIOBHAN ON SET.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I’m going to open with a joke, what do you think?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good idea. “Folks we’ll get to the news of our impending doom in a minute, but first, have you heard the one about the armless hunchback?”</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In earpiece.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">And three, two, one...</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Good evening, This is Past Prologue, I’m Siobhán Delilah Rose here with Thomas Stolen. The Hong Kong Project that sought to create a new form of digital storage that would be immune to the sun’s magnetic storms, has failed. The Project hoped to create a computer mainframe that used state of the art shielding to remain functional after a magnetic storm, but it appears now that the project’s design team was too optimistic.  We’ll have more details on this story as it develops.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">For eight months now, our sun, which for billions of years has fostered life on this planet now seems to be dead set on destroying it. Regular magnetic storms have swept across the globe at least twice a month since the storms began. They have fried everything but the most basic of circuit boards, and made all forms of digital storage impossible. We are now a modern world that can only use pre-war technology.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">As we speak, on Capitol Hill, the debate is raging on a new aid package to help those who are struggling the most with this new world we find ourselves in. No doubt, the failure of the Hong Kong Project will greatly inform the current debate. We now go live to Amanda Marie Kathrein on the steps of the capitol. Amanda, what’s the atmosphere like right now?</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Siobhan, as I’m sure you can imagine, the atmosphere has gone from tense to panicked.</p>
<p class="dialogue">At the beginning of this crisis there was a large group of members of congress who believed that the troubles would pass and soon everything would get back to normal. But as the months have gone by, those members of congress have quickly been reduced to two senators and ten representatives, now jokingly referred to as “The Ostrich Caucus.”</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are they voting on next?</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Next up is a vote to establish a nationwide network of crisis centers where Americans will be able to receive services. That vote should be happening any minute now.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we will check back with you soon... Folks, this... well this is yet another day of bad news isn’t it? I’m sure you’re watching right now, and you’re wondering “Why bother?” “Why am I sitting here watching this antique television, going out of my way to get even more bad news?” We hear you, and quite honestly, we don’t know either. Not a lot of light at the end of the tunnel, is there?</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In earpiece.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thomas, no French novels, please.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">As you know, I’m Thomas Stolen. I’m here with my dear friend Siobhan. In the control room now, begging me to not be a depressing sot is our Producer Tania Ricardo. Right next to her is Daniel Kaprat, a man whose weirdly encyclopedic knowledge of mid-century live television made all of what you’re seeing right now possible. At the capitol right now is our ONE correspondent Amanda Marie and her crew of ONE camera man, Sean Wright. We’re not much to look at, but we’re here. And we will continue to be. The world may fall apart completely, but you know what? In a few minutes Ryan Ortega is going to give us a weather report. You heard that right. Ryan has no DOPLAR, he has no satellites, nothing. But he’s going to be on in a few minutes to tell us what the weather is going to be like. The world may be broken, but it spins regardless.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO AMANDA MARIE AND SEAN AT THE CAPITOL.</p>
<p class="character">SEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we’re out, she’ll give us a thirty second warning.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thirty second warning would be nice. Yesterday when she threw to me I had half a sandwich in my hand...</p>
<p class="character">SEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You doing okay?</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yeah. I figured Hong Kong was going to shit the bed, but there was this part of me that was really hoping we would catch a break.</p>
<p class="character">SEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was their first try, maybe they’ll get their act together.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">When?</p>
<p class="character">SEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck if I know.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Police barricades everywhere, no food at the supermarket, London is flooded, I have to walk up 15 flights of stairs to get back to my apartment. We can’t go on like this.</p>
<p class="character">SEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a little funny you threw in 15 flights of stairs with those other things.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’s a tragedy, Sean.</p>
<p class="character">SEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hear you... Look I think we should remind ourselves that human beings existed a long time before circuit boards and hard drives did. I hate how much I sound like my dad when I say that but it’s true.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that sound?</p>
<p class="character">SEAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What sound?</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Listen...</p>
<p class="direction">WE ARE BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM.</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Tania?</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you put your headset on? Amanda Marie’s freaking out about something.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Amanda, what’s wrong?</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the headset.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">PUT ME ON THE AIR RIGHT FUCKING NOW!</p>
<p class="direction">THE SOUND OF SPACE TIME RUSHING BY. LEIF AND CASPAR ARE ON THE ROOF. LEIF IS BUSY SETTING UP “THE ARSENAL”. CASPAR LISTENS TO TAMARA’S VIDEO.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that’s a shame because I was just getting on the trail of my favorite one yet. Something about a man in Jerusalem in the 14th century. A man named Terric of York... I swear to God, I have found evidence of this man, Terric of York, over the last 700 years. Same guy, 700 years... What the hell does that mean, y’all?! Is there another one?! The way people are migrating across the globe now, I may never know, I’ve lost track of him at this point!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do you keep listening to that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m trying to remember anything I know about Jerusalem in the 14th century.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just for fun?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This thing Tamara said, about this guy Terric of York. It’s bugging me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">She tracked Clementine through her entire planet’s history, and then she got on the trail of this other guy. Apparently he pops up over the course of 700 years. You don’t think that’s weird?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course I think that’s weird, Caspar, everything is weird.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This seems especially weird.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, we’re floating in a ocean of doo doo right now and you’re picking up one turd and saying “hey guys, isn’t this weird?”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A 700 year old man is in a different category than the other stuff.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you going to start an old dudes club? Play some golf, secretly influence world events?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe... What’s a British guy doing in Jerusalem in the 14th century?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know he’s British?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric of York is a British name.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Crusades?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Crusades were over.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe he was on a pilgrimage?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">If he was a member of a religious order he probably would’ve changed his name to something biblical.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what to tell you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">If there are two Clementines out there, we should know about it, right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, look at all this up here. I’m a little preoccupied with the one vengeful goddess that we DO know about.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s looking pretty crazy up here. What is all this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the plan. Using the new processor we stole, I’ve put together a smaller version of the Teds’ wind chimes. When she gets here, she should, SHOULD be trapped here. While she’s trapped here the diner gets to work trying to take away her powers. If it can.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what about the part where she’s psychotic and wants to kill us?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s where I come in. I’m basically going to throw everything I’ve got at her.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which will just make her more mad.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">According to Zebulon, Clementine’s on tilt right now. I need to keep her that way. Keep her off balance. If she can’t focus I think I’ll be able to keep us safe.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Hey, if you blow her up while she’s riding away on horseback, don’t forget to save the horse.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, yes. Still.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">John Wilkes Booth.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to argue about this anymore. Remind me to tell you about the Tower of Enlightenment on Moog sometime.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. What’s this big antenna?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the Hail Mary pass.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">People who are confident in their endeavors don’t normally have a Hail Mary pass.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Never know when you’re going to need one.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, is any of this going to work?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the only play we’ve got.</p>
<p class="direction">DOWNSTAIRS IN THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She said she couldn’t get back to her people?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">While I do believe that everything must be done to stop her, it was a moment when I felt sympathy for her. I saw her wind the hands of time back and forth. I saw her erase a man only to make him somehow appear once again a moment later. Despite that, she appears unable to return to the home she is attempting to save.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She can’t go back to her version of Earth and use her power to save it, so she’s been trying to shift the timeline to give her version of Earth a better outcome.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If she can’t get back to her home, how would she even know if it worked?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think she would. It sounds like she’s been opening every door she can, hoping that the next thing she does will lead her back to the home she wants to have.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And she doesn’t know that everything she does just makes it worse. She doesn’t realize that she’s the thing that ruined it all for her version of Earth.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which is a crazy bananas paradox that shouldn’t be possible, but nobody told her it was impossible so... for her it is possible.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When she shows up again, we need to tell her what’s happening. If she knows the destruction she’s causing maybe she would stop.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie and I have discussed this very thing, Gloria. We do not believe that Clementine should be told of the destruction she has caused her people.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t? Why?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We believe that Clementine is in the thrall of something. Call it what you like, call it the devil, call it hubris. Doesn’t much matter what you call it. But she has been seduced into thinking that she has the power to steer the world as if it were a ship on the ocean. And if you were to tell her that her actions brought destruction to those she loves, there would be no repentance, there would be no reflection. There would only be the voice of that demon within her whispering in her ear: “You can change it all. You can erase your mistakes. The world is for you to shape.” And while that voice has a hold of her, every attempt to reason with her will be dry branches on a bonfire.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid Clementine has become an abomination. A monster. And though there may be within her, a child, we will not save the child without first defeating the monster.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s rare this is ever the case, Gloria. But the only solution now is an ass-whuppin’. Pardon my language.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not sure Leif is equipped to whup the demon out of her, y’all.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d have a little more faith in that odd bird up on our roof, Gloria. I believe he’s due to surprise us any time now.</p>

All of it designed by a being named Meesock who’d died a Millenia ago. Nobody knows who he was. All we have are his designs. Meesock’s Chariot, Meesock’s Onager, Meesock’s Astrolabe.

And in a system where everything’s a volume business, there was just no place for them. Sad, really. So, Meesock’s designs became an oddity, something weird that had no place in the world. Kind of like the knuckleball: weird, strangely effective, but there were really just five of six people in the game that knew how to pull it off.

There was this one old cartoon that caught my attention. Penelope Pitstop is a wealthy heiress, and the bad guy is always trying to steal her riches through these ridiculous plots. Always trying to keep her safe is the Ant Hill Mob, this group of short little gangsters who all had their own gimmick. Lots of allusions to Snow White. Dum Dum was the dumb one, Snoozy was always asleep, you get it. One member of the Ant Hill Gang was Pockets. Pockets could always reach into his pockets and pull out whatever they needed to get out of a jam, defying all laws of physics. He pulled a suspension bridge out of his pocket one time. I loved that guy. A criminal, a guy who could make things, and a guy who wanted to defend something beautiful. Anyway, I’m sure you can see where I’m going with this...</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s an unconventional choice, but Leif’s an unconventional guy, let’s watch...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Drones? What are you going to do? Annoy me to death?</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty the drones appear to be firing some sort of projectiles at a very high rate right now, let’s talk to Leif about it. Leif, what are your drones packing right now?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We see you’ve got some interesting firepower on the field right now, tell us about it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, yeah, flechette gun or a needle gun. Small, needle like projectiles fired with an electromagnet at a very high velocity.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that sounds like an ouchie factory.</p>

<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like why are our doppelgängers on the roof of a diner that’s suddenly appeared on the steps of the capitol?</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, thank you Daniel, that’s one.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know Bram, the drones looked like an odd choice at first but Clementine does seem to be having a dickens of a time getting rid of them.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe we should start with who’s breaking in to the broadcast?</p>
<p class="character">DANIEL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Only so much I can do about that, this technology is one step up from the Bronze Age.</p>
<p class="character">TANIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Folks, we don’t have any answers for you about what’s currently happening at the capitol, all we can tell you... uh...</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">All we can tell you is that we’re going to keep on this until we can tell you something, how about that?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds good.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty I’m starting to get this sense that Leif is putting together his next move and the drones are just a distraction.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, also you’re going to be hearing some other voices as we’re broadcasting. That is, unfortunately, another thing we don’t know about. They’re just kind of... here.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bram she is like Tippi Hedren out there with those drones.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m still here.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t know how else to ask this, but are... the laser beams randomly firing into the sky?</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Siobhan there now appears to be a squadron of drones? Firing something at the laser lady? And she’s firing lasers randomly at the cloud of drones? In other news, could someone please fire me for having to say what I just said?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">And this is all happening in the parking lot of the diner that has just appeared on the capitol steps.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Looks like you were right, Bram.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty it’s looking like the drones kept Clementine busy just long enough for Leif to make his next move.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And it’s gotten a chilly reception, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right, it’s looking like Clementine failed to turn before the iceberg and now she’s got passengers manning the lifeboats.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can she get out of it?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Not several hours. I need to work on my next move.</p>

<p class="dialogue">And that’s half-time. What a way to end the first half, wouldn’t you say, Kitty?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bram, as we’ve seen before, Leif loves to steal things.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is true, he is not Ronald McDonald he is the Hamburglar.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And right at the end of the first half we see it. Chemical Ice. The dreaded tool of his arch enemy, The Teds.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, if it works, it works.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You heard it right here folks, from the man himself. If it works, it works.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t go far, folks, we’re going to have more action for you, right after this break.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE BACK TO THE TV STUDIO.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay, now the voices appear to be cutting to some sort of commercial break which we’re not hearing, not sure what that’s about.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you’re just joining us... wow. How to summarize this?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">A bit of a challenge.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Earlier this evening, on the steps of the Capitol, a diner appeared.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s bizarre thing number 1.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">On the roof of that diner appeared to be... well, us. People who look exactly like myself, like Tom, as well as Sean and Tania who produce this show.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bizarre thing number 2.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then... uh...</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll take this one, and then a red-headed woman also appeared in the parking lot of the diner that had just appeared on the capitol steps... and she began shooting lasers from her hands.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, that... that happened. And that is bizarre thing number 3.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, that’s plenty of bizarre things for me. But we are not stopping there.</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">No we’re not.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because now there is a big block of ice? Is that right, Amanda?</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right, Tom. Huge block of ice.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">And do we have any idea where this block of ice may have come from?</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’m just wondering-</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You really think I’m going to know where a block of ice the size of a Ford Super Duty came from?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t uh-</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re asking me this before you ask me about the magical diner or the laser lady?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just trying to kill some time, Amanda, because apparently we’re on a commercial break!</p>
<p class="character">SIOBHÁN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Folks if you’re watching at home and think that we’re all having some sort of massive hallucination, who knows? You may be right. One thing’s for sure though, for the past several minutes I bet you haven’t been thinking about how the sun’s trying to destroy our planet.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a very important point, Siobhan. In fact I almost forgot myself.</p>
<p class="direction">WE START TO HEAR “BACK FROM COMMERCIAL” MUSIC.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, it looks like we’re hearing something again, let’s listen in. Amanda, keep that camera pointed at the action.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well what else am I going to film?</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, just making sure.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we’re back!</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bram, while we’re waiting to for the second half to begin, a bit of behind-the-scenes business. I have heard from multiple sources that right before the action began tonight, there was a dramatic change in Leif’s approach to facing off with Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that right?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true, and it all has to do with something called “Maxwell’s Demon”.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds spicy!</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, I would not be able to explain this to you, I’m no expert. Luckily, in the studio right now we have the member of the team responsible for this tactic change, Dr. Ava Maddox. Ava, how are you doing today?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh? Oh. Oh, okay. Hi.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shh. I’m doing press.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava. Maxwell’s Demon. Tell us all about it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maxwell’s Demon is a thought experiment proposed by physicist James Maxwell.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what does that have to do with our match up tonight?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maxwell’s thought experiment imagined a super-being. Someone who was able to control the flow of particles in a way that defied the laws of thermodynamics. Maxwell asked, could a being like this exist?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what does that have to do with our match up tonight?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, for a long time it was thought that Maxwell’s Demon couldn’t exist, because cheating your way out of the laws of thermodynamics would cause you to incur an entropic debt. You would be generating energy, and you don’t generate energy in any universe, you move it from one place to another.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sensing a twist.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then along comes Zurab Silagadze. He proposed that Maxwell’s Demon could exist if the demon was paying off its entropic debt through mirror mater, like mirror photons or dark matter. So we thought, what if Clementine works in a similar way?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I don’t understand a word of that but you’re saying you used this idea to take Clementine out at the knees?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s definitely working at a reduced capacity right now. She could easily get out of that block of ice had Leif not started siphoning dark matter.</p>
<p class="direction">THE ICE STARTS TO CRACK.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think the ice age is coming to an end over here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck, already?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Shit.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty, it looks like the second half is starting wether we like it or not.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine has had enough of the ice bath and she is ready to take the field.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do we do? What’s the next move?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamn it, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was hoping I’d be able to hold her off longer than this, she’s unstoppable.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody’s unstoppable, Leif. Think.</p>
<p class="direction">THE ICE KEEPS CRACKING AND WATER BEGINS RUNNING FROM IT.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The ice is melting. I think she’s raising her body temperature.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, you told me you’ve been in worse jams than this. Think about those, what did you do?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok... I would always make a plan but then there was always a point towards the end where I would have to abandon the plan and just wing it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we’re there.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty, I want to remind everyone that that is not just a block of ice Clementine is trapped in but a block of Chemical Ice, the freezing point of which is far lower than regular old H-2-O. For her to cause that to melt so fast she would have to be generating enough energy to light up South America.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bram, if Leif has a Hail Mary pass, it’s time for him to throw it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hail Mary pass! Hail Mary pass!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s the Hail Mary pass?</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need to boost the signal. We’re going all in on the Hail Mary pass. Caspar, see those two red cables?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s the dark matter energy I’ve been funneling from the surroundings.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Should I be holding these in my hands right now?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">On the Hail Mary antenna there’s two auxiliary power inputs, do you see them?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>

<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sweetie, I’ve survived 11 million versions of Caspar, I’m pretty sure I can handle you.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Whoa, language!</p>

<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, okay, fine. There’s a red headed lady with laser hands and she is currently in a fight with a... I don’t know, some sort of thing that nerds masturbate to.</p>
<p class="character">THOMAS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just trying to report the news here, Amanda.</p>
<p class="character">AMANDA MARIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well here’s some breaking news: ya’ can’t.</p>
<p class="direction">BACK IN THE PARKING LOT. THE EX AND CLEMENTINE ARE OUT OF BREATH AFTER BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF EACH OTHER.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Clementine, you know what’s funny? Look at us. We’re out of breath after trying to beat the crap out of each other. But here’s the thing: I don’t breathe. I’m an android. So what am I doing?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it’s a relic. I used to be programmed to mimic human behavior. There’s a few things I still keep around just for fun. I imagine it’s the same for you, right?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you know about me?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I can read minds, Clementine. And I’ve been trying to read yours for the past few minutes, but it’s funny... You don’t have one. You’ve Got arms, legs, a head. No brain. There’s nothing there.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I know.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a new one for me. What happened to your brains?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guess I didn’t need them.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know how you feel. I don’t have a brain either. My body is just one big slab.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t look like one big slab.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aw, I bet you say that to all the girls... It’s a little lonely, right?... Knowing there’s no one like you... Here we are, two unique beings. Maybe we should compare notes?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, thank you.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Relentless in the pursuit of your mission? Yeah, I used to be like that too. Then I realized I didn’t have to be. I realized I could let it all go. You should give it a try.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is this diner full of people who can’t shut the fuck up?</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, it’s really annoying right? It’s the ones that don’t talk that worry me though. Anytime I see someone who doesn’t talk and keeps to themself I worry about them. Because they’re afraid. They’re afraid if they open their mouth that something will change. They say something and it changes everything. That’s an amazing thing about words. I’m pretty powerful, as I’m sure you’ve noticed. The power that runs through me is the kind of thing that normal people dream of. But it’s nothing compared to someone just opening their mouth and speaking. You can say the right word at the right time and the ground can shift underneath you, a dark world becomes brighter, you can change everything about yourself in an instant, just by speaking... Give it a try Clementine... Speak...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay. Then I guess it’s back to beating the crap out of each other.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re trying to figure out what destroyed your world? It was you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought we said-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trust me.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s impossible.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re right. It is. But you can do impossible things, Clementine. It was you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I come from a destroyed world, I can’t be the cause of it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Every time you went back in time trying to save it, you destroyed it a little bit more. I know, it’s hard to understand... I’m coming down.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, what are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. I said I would handle this. I’m handling it.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Kitty, what do you think we’re looking at right now?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bram, in an unprecedented move, Leif has called a time out and is headed out on the field. It’s brief moments like this that can shift a game’s trajectory entirely. Let’s watch.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... When you put us in jail, it was on your version of Earth in the future. I imagine that was on purpose, you wanted us to see what your world had become. But there were people there. People from other planets. They were picking through the rubble, trying to find out what had happened. They had learned some things. They had learned that every bad thing that had happened on the planet happened when there was a visit from a beautiful red-headed woman named Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re lying.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t figure it out. It was Tamara. Do you remember Tamara? She was a security guard at a mall? You gave her a diamond from the surface of Mercury. She spent the rest of her life trying to figure out who you were. She learned a lot. Siberia? Indonesia? Fires in California? Does any of this sound familiar?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no way you could know that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, there’s no way you can’t know it. I know pretty well what it looks like when someone’s dancing just as fast as they can, trying to keep the truth away.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That can’t be the truth.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve been pushing through every door, weaving through history, trying to make something happen. If you stopped? For just one second? If you took one second to look back and see the trail of destruction you’re leaving behind you? You’d know I was right.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It can’t be me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know a little something about leaving a trail of destruction behind you. Sometimes it’s so much you feel like you can’t ever look back. So at a certain point you decide that the only way you can function is through denial.</p>
<p class="dialogue">It works pretty well for a while but, it’s no way to live... Clementine, we have you trapped here.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was the whole plan, okay? We get you here, we trap you here, the diner would slowly take away your powers while we duck and cover and hope you don’t kill us first.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go ahead, try to teleport away. You can’t.</p>

<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, get behind me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to turn it off. Okay? It’s okay. I’m going to turn it off, not because I’m afraid you’re going to kill me but because... Because I believe in you, Clementine. I believe in people. I believe they can change.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF PRESSES A BUTTON ON A REMOTE.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Bram, you can’t call it a victory, but everyone did walk away from this one and you can’t be mad at that.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kitty, this was the fight of Leif’s life, and what did he do? Abandoned his usual way of thinking at the last minute and used his real power: being a human being.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So poignant, Bram. So poignant. We’re going to take a quick break then we’ll be back as Bram and I brake down the match moment by moment.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought it was really beautiful, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks, Ex.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When you said you were going to abandon the plan, I was not expecting this.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wasn’t too happy about it either but, doing the math, she would’ve needed to stay here for hours before the diner could fix her. That means several hours of Clementine and the Ex pounding away at each other. They would’ve leveled the whole place.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess I could get more mad about it but I FOR REAL thought we were all dead.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, thinking back on it now, this whole thing was a terrible plan.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was our only plan.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I’m realizing now that, just because it is the only plan, does not, in fact, make it a good plan.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like that you went against our wishes, Leif, but we understand. It was made better by watching our friend deliver just a little bit of ass-whuppin’ to Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">THE EX</p>
<p class="dialogue">My pleasure.</p>

One: Meesock’s Tabernacle. This force field will hook up to any power source and give you a diffusion field that will protect you from magnetic storms but it’ll only protect one building, which is why I’m leaving you with this. A copy of the Mysteries of Meesock. All kinds of interesting things in there that will help the world get through this trying time. There’s an abandoned gold mine is South Dakota that’s already set up for experiments and it’s deep enough to protect you from magnetic storms. Good luck.</p>
