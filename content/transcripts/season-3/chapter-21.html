<p class="direction">PHONE HANGS UP. DOOR OPENS.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need to get a website.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t want to do that.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course I do.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you get a website then more people will come here and that’s more work for me. Don’t do that to me.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You had to clean one room today.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But what a room it was. Those people were a mess, dude, what was their deal?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think they were skiers.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not ski season.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Getting an early start?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They were doing something strange with the trash cans. I don’t want to know what.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re going to need more than one guest per night to stay above water.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but what about my needs? Like my need to get paid for doing very little.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you at least pretend I’m your boss?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Hey, you know what I heard at the bar last night? I heard this place was in a meth corridor.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is a meth corridor?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s, you know, the corridor through which meth moves.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">People steal cars, and then they use the stolen cars to move meth around the state. They don’t want to get pulled over so they stick to the back roads. Boom, meth corridor.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we’re in the meth corridor?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And who did you hear this from?</p>

<p class="dialogue">...Edgy Steve.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know someone named Edgy Steve?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, I don’t KNOW HIM know him, but I see him sometimes, he’s around.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And how does “Edgy Steve” know about the meth corridor?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s a meth dealer.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Great.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me ask you this: A lot of people checking in driving Saturns?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Saturns? Uh... sometimes, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Most stolen car in America.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Saturns are?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can start them just by shoving a flat head screwdriver in the ignition.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then who would want to steal a Saturn?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">People doing illegal things. Like?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Transporting meth through the meth corridor?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. How often do people check in driving a Saturn?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Often.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They pay in cash?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, their money’s green.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Their money is drug money.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry about it. The Hilton family started out as brothel owners. You should own it. You don’t want their business going to the Red Roof Inn or whatever. That’s YOUR drug money.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did my dad not tell me this?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He probably didn’t even know. He probably stood behind the counter and was like “Oh, well, another fine gentleman staying at our establishment with hives and face tatoo, what are the odds?”</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone’s going to get shot here over a drug deal gone wrong or something.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, dude, you’re not the destination for the drugs you’re in the corridor for the drugs. It’s harmless.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">June-</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And it said that sometimes when a person loses a loved one they can, as a way of coping, take on the personality traits of the person they’ve lost... Uncle Pete was a pretty buttoned up guy... like literally. He’s the only guy I knew who used the top button of his shirt.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>

<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A little. Look I’m not expecting you to rip your shirt off and run through the woods or anything I’m just saying, I would like my cousin Frank to remain my cousin Frank, is all.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. When you disappeared from the hospital the police showed up and they took it I think. You could probably get it from the station, they probably have it in a box somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am just now realizing that, because you left your clothes behind, you escaped the hospital with your ass hanging out. Power move.</p>

<p class="dialogue">No, it doesn’t. That’s the thing. It feels like... It feels like it’s gone.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s nice.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, being a sister-like cousin is great because I can constantly shift between big sister and little sister vibes. One minute I can be like “What do I do, Big Brother?” And then the next I can be like “Shut up! Do what I say!”.</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s okay. Maybe I do? What does it feel like to have siblings?</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, my God...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Well... What now?</p>
<p class="direction">ANOTHER SIMI TRUCK ROARS BY AND WE SLOWLY TRANSITION TO THE SILENCE OF SNOWFALL. THE DOOR TO THE OFFICE OPENS AND WE HEAR MUSIC INSIDE. FEET IN THE SNOW APPROACH.</p>
<p class="direction">JUNE (CONT’D) Hey.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you think, do you think winter’s here?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like the snow is a clear indicator that winter is here, yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aren’t we usually full of skiers right now?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a jack-knifed truck a few miles back. People have been stuck for hours.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really excited about how grumpy they’re going to be when they check in.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s going to be great.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We’ve never skied... Isn’t that weird? Most of our lives in the shadow of the misty mountain and we’ve never skied.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Way I see it, life itself is already a too-fast careening down a mountain without any breaks, why do it twice?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Easy there, Cormac McCarthy... What are you looking at?</p>
<p class="direction">A CAR DRIVES BY.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That same car keeps driving by.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It does? Are you sure?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Yellow Chevy Chevelle.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many times?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Four times today.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t dump someone, did you? Are you being stalked?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t FEEL stalked. What’s the big deal?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing... Nothing, it’s fine... Are all the faucets running a little bit?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I still think that’s weird, but all the faucets are running just a little.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It keeps them from freezing up.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How? If water wants to freeze, it’s going to freeze.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The pipes have water in them even if they’re not being used, if you keep it moving they can’t freeze up.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That might be the most I’ve-been-an-old-man-since-I-was-twelve thing you’ve ever said.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doesn’t make it not true.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I am... finally ready to talk about the gold bar.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Finally.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I realize it’s been a while.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A while since the weirdest thing that’s ever happened to us? Yes, it has.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It scared the shit out of me.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything scares the shit out of you.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it doesn’t.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry. Most things.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did it ever occur to you that the reason I have to freak out about things like, I don’t know, a random huge bar of gold being dropped in our lap, is because you don’t freak out about it enough.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but also my brain isn’t made of bees like yours is.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Buzz buzz buzz all the time.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever. Look, I’ve gone back and forth about it, I think we need to call the police and just tell them everything.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">For months we’ve been sitting here with a giant gold bar in our safe and all you’ve come up with is the most boring option?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was the first thing I thought to do and then I eventually came back around to it. Look we just tell the sheriff’s department that we didn’t know what to do so we hung onto it in case she came back for it. She’s now obviously not coming back for it so we decided to call the police.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just... I’m so disappointed in you. After all this time.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if it belongs to someone and they’re looking for it?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? Are you worried there’s some impoverished family somewhere that’s starving because they can’t find their bar of gold?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. June, do you know what the price of gold per ounce is? I looked it up.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like fifteen-hundred dollars an ounce.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That bar is the size of a sleeve of saltines. Do you know how many ounces that is?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds like a lot.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is a lot. What do you want me to do, put it in the bank?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course not.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s your idea, then?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Melt it down.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Melt it down how? Find a blacksmith?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are no more blacksmiths.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know a guy.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh God.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We used to date. He’s super hot, but he wanted me to raise chickens or something he’s a weird guy.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you wind up dating a blacksmith?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frankie, it’s central Oregon, do you know how many people there are in those woods practicing professions that have been obsolete for a hundred years? It’s the making-soap-from-beef-tallow Capitol of the world around here.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who the hell is this?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know him.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yep.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">T.S.?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yep.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">T.S. is a blacksmith.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Think about it for a second, it all makes sense.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...T.S. is a terrible name for a blacksmith.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s because you don’t know what the T.S. stands for, do you want to know what it stands for?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tarvok Stormbringer.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He had it legally changed, it’s on his driver’s license.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know it’s from some book or something.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">He went through all the trouble to change his name and then calls himself T.S.?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s even funnier that he kept his last name, so his legal name is Tarvok Stormbringer LeClerque.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God... Sure, great idea. Let’s trust our thousands of dollars of gold to the guy who rides a Gryphon to work in the morning.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s more on-brand than you think it is. I mean, “What do I do with all my gold” is kind of a fantasy novel problem.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What kind of world are we living in where having a bunch of gold is a problem?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s nice up here.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">HOW did you get on the roof?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know I haven’t been here the whole time?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean... at this point I’d believe anything.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d you get past the wreck on the highway?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I was on my moped so I just zipped right through.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m kidding, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had no idea there was roof access, I’m going to be up there all the time now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You seem different, Clementine. Did you get your memory back?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t. I did learn alllllll sorts of other things though.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like what?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, hang on. Clementine... What the fuck?</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE What?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a bar of gold in our safe, Clementine.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then you just vanished.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And now you show up. On our roof.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I repeat: What the fuck?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s funny, isn’t it? Unexpected gifts. Things come to us out of thin air and then we... well we just reject them, don’t we? “This good thing can’t be happening. It has to be a bad thing in disguise. I better not accept it. I better treat it like a bad thing, I better worry about it and yell at people and if anyone tries to congratulate me for this good thing that happened out of the blue I better shut them down.”... Right? Or we could do something else couldn’t we? We could just say thanks. Enjoy it. Why don’t we do that?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because nothing is ever just one thing, Clementine. The world’s not that simple.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I want it to be.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me too. Doesn’t really matter what I want, though.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... He’s kind of a pill, isn’t he?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He is. It’s why I love him.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why don’t you get down from the roof and tell us some things, Clementine?</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Okay.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Don’t jump-</p>

<p class="dialogue">For, y’know, winter?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, fine.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE INSIDE THE OFFICE.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You may not remember some things but we’re not getting the full story are we?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It really is beautiful, isn’t it? One thing I did learn: I learned that gold is made inside of a star. It cooks inside a star for billions of years. Then when the star finally grows old and dies, it coughs up all the gold and sends it flying across the universe... Gold is the dying breath of a star.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s cool. I didn’t know that.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if I told you that’s where I got it from? That I was there when a star died and I caught some of its gold, some of that dying breath. And then I found a man in Australia who could take what I found and press it into this little bar for you. This gold has travelled a long way to get here, Frank.</p>

<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that right?</p>
<p class="character">JOHN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid so.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I will forever be envious of her ability to wriggle her way out of things.</p>
<p class="character">JOHN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is rather inconvenient that the American people have elected you and not her, Mr. President.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I agree. So I’m to attend this evening as some sort of unshaven bachelor, then.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Not as such, Mr. President, no.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s that?</p>

<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I agree.</p>
<p class="character">JOHN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Appropriate that we’re seeing a play this evening. I propose a bit of stagecraft.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Stagecraft? John, will I be wearing makeup at some point this evening?</p>
<p class="character">JOHN</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Mr. President but we will be putting on a bit of a show. A play within a play if you will.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am honored to be in your presence.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am honored to be in yours. Your title does roll off the tongue much easier than “Mr. President”.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The difference being, yours was earned and mine simply given.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">So to what do I owe a diplomatic visit from the Kingdom of Luxembourg?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are a young nation, as you are, and we wished to learn from you.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Learn from our mistakes, you mean.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course not. We admire your nation.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not much to admire at the moment, Countess. We are, in fact, quite a mess at the moment.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yet you endure.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... yes I suppose we do.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are a nation created by disagreement. The Belgians, the Germans, the French, they all insist we belong to them. When they are unable to agree we were suddenly left to our own devices. And now I stand before you.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Yes.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Due to the particulars of my tenure, I have not had the time I would have liked to devote to foreign affairs.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is understandable.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Though, in the time I have had, I have discovered one truth: that no foreign dignitary ever requested to meet just to say hello. Do we have business, you and I?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No business.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Countess, that is simply not true.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>

<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see. And what is that?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I do not know.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah. Well that is not what I expected you to say.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you had this feeling? Searching without knowing what you search for?</p>
<p class="direction">ABRAHAM LINCOLN Certainly.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And how did you go about this? This searching without a proper goal?</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Start with a word. That’s what I like to do. You can use one word and one word only that describes what’s absent. Give it a try.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Home.</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aha. Well there is a word that is far more elusive than one might think. One of those words that’s a feeling disguised as a place. I do hate that.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you suggest as a remedy?</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hmm... Art.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Art?</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I’ve been told that you’re to accompany me this evening to see a play. I’ve found that art does illuminate the places in one’s soul that have dwelled in darkness.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is this play?</p>
<p class="character">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our American Cousin. I’m sure it’s quite bad, in truth. But bad art and good can equally illuminate, though one is certainly more enjoyable than the other.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Everything.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Come again?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe you’ll need more pages in that book then.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not an actual map, it’s just kind of a concept.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of everything.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. A friend of mine discovered something and no one would believe her. I didn’t either for a while, but now I’m pretty sure she was right.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why wouldn’t anyone believe her?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, in science there’s sort of a marketplace of ideas. You had a tractor back home, right?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes. Very nice one.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We called it Sampson.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did you have before that?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We always had Sampson but before that my father just had a mule.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was also named Sampson.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was an homage.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, so tractors came along and you didn’t need the mule anymore right? Which I’m sure was good news for everyone but the guy who sold the mules. The scientific world can, sometimes, be full of mule salesmen who are always skeptical about tractors.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see. So your friend, she invented a tractor in a world full of mule sellers.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what is the shape and size of this tractor, exactly?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... How did the universe begin? In the bible?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Dear, she’s asking us about the Bible.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, no sudden movements, we may scare her away.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">C’mon.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, Ava, it’s interesting. There are, in fact, dueling theories on the beginning of all things.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. There are two interpretations of how the Lord created the world entire. They are called “Logos” and “Agon”.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Speech and Struggle?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Precisely. In one interpretation, with speech alone God created the world.</p>
<p class="dialogue">He spoke and matter itself would bend to his will, and through his words the world came to be. And the other interpretation, Struggle, involved a great battle.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That one talks of God as a warrior, and the world before him was one of chaos. He brought order to the chaos by defeating great sea monsters and such.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mot, Yam, Tannin, and Leviathan. The Psalms read: “You it was who smashed Yam with your might, who battered the heads of the monsters in the waters; You it was who crushed the heads of Leviathan, who left them for food for the denizens of the desert.”</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That second one’s way cooler.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I like it too, it makes me feel better about my hatred for catfish.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But if you’re speaking of a map of all creation, for us it is never truly settled. The old Israelites believed the world to be like a great disc floating in a great ocean, but then that began to change.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did it change?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, because of the arrival of people such as you, Ava. Men built great looking glasses that peered into the sky and our concept of the ground we stand on began to slowly change, and thus did our concept of its beginnings.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">C’mon Mucklewains, I thought it was the word of God, I thought it was immutable.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, well...</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We, in fact... well we believe that holy scripture was written by God’s children and not God himself.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which can get one into trouble in certain circles.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is the word and there is the world. And we find both to be perfect.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then there is the word and its interpretation.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And one cannot interpret without putting at least a bit of oneself into it. And we are, by design, imperfect, therefore so shall our interpretations be.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then how do you ever know what to believe?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is the journey, Ava. And the fuel for that journey is faith.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So tell us, what was your friend’s interpretation of everything?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She described it like a play. The beginning of all things is like a curtain rising. And every particle in the universe is a player in a great piece of theatre. And then eventually the curtain falls. That’s not much different from what any other cosmologist would say. What my friend proved was that, also like a play, the curtain comes up again the next night. Sometimes the play is the same, sometimes it’s different, but it continues on and on into eternity... and somehow all of that has something to do with a time-traveling, dimension-spanning diner. Which is hilarious.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh... Okay... You know I’m trying to feel a certain way about that but I got nothing. Is this what it’s like being Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did you do?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I met him in the alley with the horse, and as he was riding away I... I blew him up.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You blew him up!?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is that worse?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know?!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is the horse okay?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The horse is fine.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie, Zebulon. Help me out here.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif. Murder is wrong.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Alright, well good.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s it?! Zebulon?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes I... hm. Well...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, look. You’re the history buff. What was GOING to happen to him.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was... going to go hide in a Barn in Port Royal and then get shot in the neck by a Union soldier a couple of days later.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. And was there some sort of impassioned speech at the end about tyranny or whatever?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. So the outcome is the same, I just saved the world from having to hear an impassioned speech from a straight-up-evil dude.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, no one’s given me credit yet for blowing up a dude on horseback and NOT killing the horse. That’s called precision demolition, it’s a lost art.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel weird about this.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ll be fine.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who? Oh. It’s the fucking Ambassador from Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s having a weird day.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She needs to get out of the parking lot, we’re going to jump soon.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh NOW you’re concerned for people.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Innocent people, sure.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll go talk to her.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME. CASPAR STEPS OUTSIDE.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good evening, Madam Ambassador. May I help you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What an unusual building.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Architects these days. May I escort you back to town, you must be in quite a state considering this evening’s events.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Am I certain of what?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you certain of who you say you are?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m quite certain.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have excellent ability to detect deception.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you now?</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What would your sense of deception say about a woman calling herself Countess Jacquetta of Luxembourg when Countess Jacquetta was murdered in the 15th century. She was thought to be a witch. Have you risen from the grave to enact your revenge on mankind, Countess?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, I have a very strange feeling.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell is that?!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, we don’t know that either.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like this place. What is this place?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Calm down, just tell us your name.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you trying to stop me? I won’t stop.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoever you are, we think you may be doing something bad.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No... No, I’m too close.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Too close to what?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me who you are!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">See... Told you I’d be right eventually.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Everybody inside. Time to make plans.</p>
<p class="direction">WE SLOWLY TRANSITION TO THE SOUNDS OF A BUST DMV OFFICE. A PHONE IS RINGING.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello?... Yeah, look I can’t talk about this right now, I’m slammed, okay? We’ll.... We’ll have to talk about it later, I’m not doing this now. Goodbye.</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR HANGS UP.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">322? When you sign the wait list you need a first and last name okay? Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. That’s me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s your last name, Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. I don’t have one.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t have one.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Can I get one here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Clementine, you cannot get a last name at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Is there anything else I can help you with?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... Yes, I think there is, Caspar.</p>
