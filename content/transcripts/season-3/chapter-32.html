<p class="direction">SPACETIME RUSHES BY. CLEMENTINE AND AVA ARE IN THE PARKING LOT.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There was a brief moment when I knew everything. Every bit of information that could be known was inside me for less than a second... I didn’t have a body or... I just existed somehow... But I had this faint memory of who I was. I didn’t know my name or my history but I had this image, this... ghost... and then I realized I could move things. I could draw things together... I created an idea of me, of an identity, and I kept drawing things toward it. Gasses and planets and stars were drawn towards this idea of me. It happened faster and faster. With every particle I brought towards me I got more and more powerful... I began to have a center. I began to have a place to put myself. I began to see myself... I was a dark heart floating in the stars. I absorbed matter and light and energy. I was the deepest darkness, filled with complexity, surrounded by a halo of light... nothing could escape me... And then I could look down to see my hand, and I realized I had eyes, my bare feet floated above a galaxy... I suddenly existed. I was floating in space... Then something started pulling me, and I was falling. The faster I fell the more human I felt... And then I was in the parking lot of a motel... That’s how it started. I don’t know what all that means.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t either, but it still explains a lot.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It does?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any universe is mostly a void but it’s still an ecosystem in a way. It ebbs and flows. It even has weather to a certain extent. A supernova billions of miles away can make clouds appear on Earth. The distance between things may be vast, but they still effect each other like an ecosystem. And like any ecosystem, it has its... megafauna.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Megafauna?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria’s first day here we encountered something called a Transdimensional Haboob. Basically a sentient weather system that can cross dimensional barriers. Leif can tell you about something called The Galaxy Brain, a remnant of an organism that was the size of a planetoid. No ecosystem would be complete without its lumbering giants. Added to the list now is Clementine: the human that somehow became a Black Hole that somehow became human.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m... a black hole?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not in the classic sense. You weren’t a star that exploded. But the idea of drawing everything into you, becoming more powerful with every particle... you’re a walking, talking black hole.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that possible? A black hole isn’t a person.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we’ve never had a conversation with one, have we? There’s a theory that consciousness is related to complexity. I’m conscious because inside my skull there is the very complex system of my brain. And if consciousness arises from complexity, there’s nothing more complex than the inside of a black hole. So who knows? Maybe all those dark hearts out there, sucking in all the light, maybe they are conscious like you and me.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... These megafauna you’re talking about. Is that what just tried to kill me?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, that’s another. Chuck, the four dimensional entity. Sorry about that. We thought he was a friend.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is he still trying to kill me?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Should he have?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure?... I’m not... I destroyed my planet, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were doing what everyone does. You were trying to do what you thought was right using the information and power that you have. You didn’t know what you were doing. Could you have listened to us a little better? Yes. But who listens... I don’t.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I want it to stop.</p>
<p class="direction">AVA HITS CLEMENTINE IN THE ARM.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ow!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did that hurt?</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You withstood a blast from a particle cannon a few days ago, now it hurts when I hit you in the arm. In a few hours you’ll probably have a bruise. If you stop and listen for a second you’ll probably feel your heart beating... Welcome to the human race. It sucks.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You kind of talk about really big mysteries like they’re no big deal.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s strange, what my curiosity latches onto. There are a lot of mysteries out there. Too many to count. For some reason I’m able to ignore most of them. For me it’s always been about one big mystery. A mystery that hovers over all the other mysteries. The big picture that’s even bigger than the big picture. That’s what I’ve always focused on. I have no idea how you were a disembodied consciousness that formed a black hole around it then transformed yourself into a space goddess, but it sounds like that’s what happened.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t understand how this happened to me. Why me?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the really confusing part. You were a person, and then something happened to you, and then you were just... a cluster of awareness, and then you were an inescapable center of gravity and then you were... this. Something’s missing from the equation and I don’t know what it is. The type of energy that you emit and that created you, it’s damage. Damage to the fabric of space/time. A gravity wave can cause it, but with all the damage that we’ve been seeing out there, something really big would have had to happen. Bigger than any of those black holes or megafauna.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s bigger than a black hole?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing... Nothing is...</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?... What’s going on in your head right now?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... A 1972 Buick Skylark floating in space.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Uh...</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have to go.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello there doctor, I-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, hi.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay... What’s going on with her?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How are you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Flesh and blood again.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What were you before?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does it feel?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It hurts.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Terric, I’m so-</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was a clown for a while.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You... what?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">A clown.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was this whole trend in the 17th century in France. Acting companies would pack up a wagon and go from village to village. I would come out before the show and warm up the crowd.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... As a clown.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t have a red nose or anything. I’d do some of my act for you, but it’s in French.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric-</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">They called me Monsieur Impertinent... Mr. Saucy.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re trying to make me laugh.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course I am, I’m a clown.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s been seven hundred years and you’re still trying to take care of me. You shouldn’t be doing that.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We’ve both been through a lot. To hear them tell it, you got the worst of it.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric, the difference is that I did this to you. You didn’t do this to me. The amount... the amount of pain I’ve caused and then I see you... I did it to you too. I fantasized that you were untouched by it all, that once upon a time, for a minute, I did something good and normal and real. I met a man and I fell in love... but turns out I ruined that too. You shouldn’t have had this life Terric. You should’ve had a life with your weird books in that city you loved... you should’ve found someone who could love you the way you deserved to be loved, you should’ve had a good life. You should’ve had a pretty wife who’s nuts about you, you should’ve had children.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I’ve had many children.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You... what?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was seven hundred years.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you...</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was seven hundred years did you expect me to wait for you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean... kind of.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I didn’t. Did you wait for me?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was busy.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Destroying the universe, I heard.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE I...</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you need to admit that you imagined me as this lonely soul out there, who could never love again and was constantly longing for your return.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, let’s put it this way: yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Who was she?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which one?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which one?!</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was seven hundred years.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many women did you marry, Terric?!</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just two, I wasn’t Gengis Khan or something.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did they know about each other?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m also not a Mormon, they were two hundred years apart.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Was one of them French?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course one of them was French.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamn it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Angélique.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, barf.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Angélique...</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There’s been no one else?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There was a guy in India one time.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aha.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He became a Buddhist and it got weird.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I’m sure it was the Buddhism that made it weird and not you being an out of control space demon.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, shut up, you fucking clown... I thought you came out here to make me feel better.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You told me not to do that... What I’m trying to say is, you seem to see me as one of your victims. I don’t feel like a victim. My life has been a life. It was full of a lot of things. Some of them very bad. Some of them very good. Like anyone’s life, really.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You should be more angry with me.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">My love, we are in a parking lot of a diner that is currently either folding space or creating a warp bubble, I’m not sure, I only have a Masters in physics. We apparently just prevented an entire universe from filling up with Hyundai Sonatas. I’m seven hundred years old, you are a celestial super-being who was nearly murdered right in front of me by another celestial super-being. Who has time for anger?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Call me “my love” again.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR AVA WRITING FURIOUSLY IN HER NOTEBOOK.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, Ava’s back on her bullshit, then?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">She has gone to the math place.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, what is she writing?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not getting close to her I don’t want to lose a finger.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are those My Little Ponies on her pencils?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, she’s using them.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re coming in for a landing any time now. What’s our game plan, here?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie, any feelings about where we’re going?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t tell you much, Gloria. All I can tell you is we’re headed into darkness.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fun.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t really track.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been to Clementine’s world. We served Brunch there for weeks. It was a wreck, for sure, but I don’t know if “darkness” is the word I would use.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe it’s a metaphorical darkness, like the dark ages.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I ain’t speaking in metaphors, I’m talking about pitch black darkness, y’all.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">When we spoke, she told me that the stars had all been extinguished. Can such a thing occur?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s the heat death of the universe. Eventually every universe gets to a state where all the energy has dissipated and there are no more stars, but there’s not supposed to be anyone alive at that point. At least I don’t think so, that’s Ava’s department.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever we’re looking at, we should adjust our expectations. I know we like to swoop in wearing red capes, but we’re not going to be able to fix a dead universe in 12 hours. It’s good that Clementine’s going home, but that may only be good news for us, not her. We may be dropping her off in a hellscape. How do we feel about that?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re being a wet blanket, that’s how I feel about it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, c’mon.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, why don’t you leave the prophecies to me?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your prophecy was one word: darkness. What are we supposed to do with that?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perhaps not be a wet blanket?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry maybe it’s one of those times where darkness is good news. Remember all those times?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Bible began with darkness.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you, dear.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The bible began with a sheep herder eating the wrong mushrooms about seven thousand years ago and writing some of his ideas down, let’s be real-</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am going to climb right out of this radio-</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">-Oh I’d love to see you try-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, here’s the plan. We’re going to set down in Clementine’s home and we’re going to swing for the fences, okay? I don’t know how much we can help but we’re going to help as much as we can and Caspar is going to take his pessimism and shove it somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got a commitment to the truth is all.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve a commitment to wet-blanketry is what you’ve got.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do we think Clementine’s in any state to start talking?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe. I saw them laugh out there.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? Well, let’s join the party.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME. THEY ALL MOVE OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA (CONT'D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey kids.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you feeling, Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s been a while since I was human. I’m having a hard time standing up.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re about to touch down. Terric, can you help her out?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ow. Ow ow ow. Okay. Standing is harder than I remember.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been talking. By all accounts we’re headed into some pretty rough territory.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you give us some idea of where we’re headed?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s probably best if you just see it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I apologize in advance.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you’re going to want to save them all, like I did.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You never know. Maybe we’ll be able to help.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think you understand where we’re headed.</p>
<p class="direction">THERE IS A CRACK AND THE DINER SETS DOWN. THEY ARE INSIDE A MASSIVE SPACE SHIP. THE CRACK OF THEIR ARRIVAL ECHOES DOWN ITS HULL AND THE SHIP OCCASIONALLY GROANS LIKE THE PLANKS OF AN OLD GALLEON.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This isn’t Earth.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s not. Clementine this isn’t Earth.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wasn’t born on Earth. None of us were.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, my God.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lord, I’ve never seen anything so big.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is a vessel?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome to The Pyrophyte.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You lived here?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">My whole life.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many people are here, Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Around twenty-seven thousand.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck, it’s a generation ship.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was supposed to be. But my grandmother boarded this ship when she was two years old. My mother was supposed to be the first generation to set foot on a new world... Didn’t work out that way. I’m the third generation to live here.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right before Earth collapsed... Right before I collapsed Earth, a small group climbed aboard this thing.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Holy shit.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How big is this thing?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Three kilometers.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Holy shit. What’s the fuel source?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... Is that a T.G.I. Friday’s across the way?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Yeah. That’s kind of funny. Looks like you landed in Nostalgia Pavilion. Nobody comes up here anymore. They set up a little mall area on this deck to remind people what it was like on Earth. It wasn’t really designed to last for three generations, it’s all run down now.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It had to be a fucking Friday’s, huh?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the only world you’ve ever known?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Until I was transformed into... whatever it was, this was the only place I’d ever been.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s why you couldn’t look at the sky when I met you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d lived my whole life inside this place. Can you imagine having a roof over your head your whole life and then suddenly seeing the sky?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, this vessel of yours. It is not underway.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it isn’t.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No... It isn’t.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re just... floating in space?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happened?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The day it hit us, I was in my mother’s womb. It made her go into labor early, apparently.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What hit you?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t know. It wiped out the historical archives. Most of the operating systems. They managed to power up the engines enough to keep the lights on but...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait. This happened when you were born?</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Yes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve lived your entire life on a derelict space ship.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you still alive?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Luck. The ship was built to last for decades but it wasn’t meant to last this long. My entire childhood was filled with emergencies. An alarm would go off and my mom would pick me up and carry me to an escape pod. She would strap me in, kiss me on the head and then we would wait... And wait... Eventually they would patch something up and the danger would pass. We all got used to it. It just became part of life. We managed to stay hopeful somehow. We relied on each other. But then, when my mother died, a few days later the stars went out. That’s when most of us gave up hope entirely.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, then there’s that. Clementine, what do you mean the stars went out? Can you get me to an observation deck or something? I need to see what you’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif. You’re on an observation deck right now. Look up. This domed ceiling. It’s all glass. You should be seeing the stars right now.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck.</p>

<p class="dialogue">There’s nothing there.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did it happen?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. We were having a memorial service for her and then I looked up and... it’s like the stars were being devoured. Darkness moved across the sky and they were gone.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No idea.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, when you came to us on our farm. How did you become that person?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know that either. After the funeral we had all spent a year in the darkness. Finding the strength to get out of bed was hard enough, but everyone on the ship had lost all hope and you could feel it. It was like we were all walking through tar... I was in my quarters, we were coming up on her birthday and I just... I started screaming... I screamed so loud I thought I would completely destroy myself... I guess I did. That’s the last thing I remember.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is an unholy place, Gloria.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s not like we can get out and start rowing.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t even want to talk about what’s impossible and what isn’t. Let’s just focus on getting information, okay? I’m going to go with Terric and Clementine — I’ll take the Mucklewains. Caspar stay here with Ava until she decides to come up for air. Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah?</p>

<p class="dialogue">We’re doing earpieces now?</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s a ghost town where I am as well. Which is concerning because it looks like I’m headed for the bridge.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m seeing people... It’s weird. They just seem to be wandering around. They all seem kind of aimless.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were having a hard time finding things for everyone to do. With the ship just drifting, there was a lot less to do unless you were in an Ag Dome or in maintenance.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s an Ag Dome?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s where I work.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you not know?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like I said, the day I was born the ship was hit by something. Apparently we had a massive archive of Earth knowledge. We lost all of it. We’ve tried to hang on to what we remember, but, without a definitive record people started arguing over what was true and what wasn’t. With no one agreeing, we couldn’t teach each other about our history. It was hard enough with my mother’s generation, learning about a planet that no one would ever see again.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">People can’t have already forgotten everything.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not that they’ve forgotten it’s... you know what, why don’t I show you? Let’s get off here.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You can just break in?</p>

<p class="dialogue">How is that possible?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine everything’s running out of engineering at this point like you would with a space station. If the ship can’t fly it doesn’t really need someone to steer it. If Clementine’s right, this thing has been derelict for decades. We’re basically sitting in an idling car with the AC on.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Now what do we do?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="dialogue">I haven’t seen you in ages, look at you. Everyone, this is Miranda, one of my very first students.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, kids.</p>
<p class="character">OLIVIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are your friends?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um... so they work on the historical archives deck.</p>
<p class="character">OLIVIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t know we still had people working there, the archives were all destroyed.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... Or so we thought. They just recently were able to recover some files on... on Marie Antionette and Terric here has come down to tell you about her, right Terric?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, right. That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p class="character">OLIVIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s so wonderful. Please, tell us what you know, Terric.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go warm up the crowd, Mr. Saucy.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Okay, hello, children... Marie Antionette... She was a queen, that’s true. She was very young. Not much older than you kids are. She became queen and it instantly became her job to wear lavish dresses and go to parties and not much else. She was constantly criticized from both ends. When she went to parties she was called out of touch with her people, and when she didn’t go to parties she was called a disgrace. You see, Marie Antionette had already committed the biggest crime in the mind of any Frenchman: she wasn’t French. She was from Austria. Even if she somehow did everything right, she would still be considered a foreigner. She never said “let them eat cake” and she wasn’t evil. She was just a girl. She did what was expected of her, her whole life and it was never enough for anyone. And then when the revolution came, she was dragged through the street, her head shaved, dressed in rags.</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was... “Pardon me, sir. I didn’t mean it.” Those were her last words.</p>
<p class="character">OLIVIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, my.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was this strange thing that happened on Earth. We took people and we made them symbols of a problem. That’s a natural thing, human beings think symbolically. But we had a tendency to think that when we got rid of the symbol, we got rid of the problem. Marie Antionette and others like her were killed in the revolution. The people said they no longer wanted to live under an iron fist. But those same people found themselves, just a few years later, in a military dictatorship. They got rid of the people. Maybe not the problem... I’m sorry, how old are they?</p>
<p class="character">OLIVIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">About ten years old.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>

<p class="dialogue">When they first started this dome, someone was assigned to each crop, but over the years the numbers dwindled. This dome was all about what life would be like in our new home, but people were less and less concerned about that as the years went by. There used to be five test domes like this, we’re the last one. As a little girl, my mother and I worked here.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>

And then I showed up in the parking lot the other day and I saw your face and something terrible happened. “Oh, God.” I thought. “Oh, God, it was actually true”... Nothing had changed, Terric... I love you. And the time I spent away from you is like a hole in me... If I strand you here with me you’re just adding to the list things that I’ve destroyed. Please don’t do that to me.</p>

<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I admire what you’re doing. You’re looking at all the things that you’ve done and you’ve decided that the only way you can live with yourself is to orchestrate some kind of punishment, right? If you condemn yourself to a short and lonely life, wandering the beet field it will somehow make up for the destruction you’ve caused. Is that the plan? Well, first of all, it won’t make up for anything. You inadvertently dropped an asteroid on Earth, turned a mall full of people into zombies, and a whole host of other horrible things — I know, I was there to see them. None of that is going to be healed by you being sad for a while. The universe finds your personal suffering to be pretty irrelevant. As a former Roman Catholic, take it from me.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... I had the pleasure of meeting Caspar the other day. You’ve met Caspar... he’s an interesting guy, I’ve never really met anyone like him. He is, nose to tail, just a pile of regrets. That’s all he is. All he seems to consist of are his mistakes. And yet, he endures. He gets up the next day and continues even when he feels like he shouldn’t deserve it, even when he feels like it’s pointless. At some point he just decided that life is about the next day. And nothing else. Because how else would you function?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric, there’s “fucking up a lot,” and then there’s “fucking up an entire planet.” These are two different things. It’s not the usual list of mistakes I have to recover from, it’s so much worse.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, the other day I was confronted with a long list of all aliases I’ve had over the centuries. For the first time I was confronted by the one alias that I didn’t choose: The Demon of Breitenfeld.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">At a certain point I had to admit that what was happening to me wasn’t normal. I couldn’t explain it away anymore. Everyone I had ever known was dead. It was pretty terrifying. It was a level of loneliness I don’t think anyone’s ever felt. I needed this inexplicable part of me to make sense somehow... Then I got word that war had broken out in Europe. A religious war... I somehow convinced myself that that was my purpose. I was meant to be God’s man on Earth, here to do his bidding. So I traveled to the Kingdom of Sweden and I joined up with the Protestants... I was always a terrible swordsman but that doesn’t seem to matter when you can’t be killed... There was a battle near the town of Breitenfeld, the worst one of the entire war... I’ll spare you the details... I killed people, Clementine. Willingly... I can still see their faces... The war ended, nothing changed, and then... and then a hundred years later I could truly look back to see that this religious war wasn’t a religious war at all. It wasn’t a war between Protestants and Catholics it was a war between Feudalism and Capitalism. Religion was just the paint job... A lot of senseless death... And then I became a clown. And then I got married and had children, and then a couple of centuries later I did it all over again. I saw and did so many things. Good things. Things I’m proud to remember, and I did them all while still being haunted by that war. No one can live their life devoid of guilt or regret. But you’re not supposed to stop living because of it. You carry it with you, you honor it, but that’s not all you’re meant to do... If I can do it, so can you... We’ll do it together.</p>

What do we do? “Can’t make stew without looking in the cupboard.” Right... okay inventory... One completely fucked generation ship. Twenty seven thousand completely fucked passengers. One practically useless communications laser. Two extra-vehicular maintenance units. Looks like one welding unit and one riveting unit. The ship’s power source is reliable but I have no idea what it is because, and this is the crux of it: there is no navigation system. It’s been completely wiped. Back at the diner I’ve got a quantum processor that I could use to create a navigation interface for the ship. Could I do that in eleven hours? No. And even if I could, who would fly it after I’m gone... I could stay... I could stay aboard this ship, write the code in a few weeks and get them to safety. That would save them. Find them a shitty planet somewhere... save the human race... “And how would you feel about that, Kid?”... These are humans. These are my people... I have to save them somehow. “Buster, you and I both know that you haven’t been a member of the human race for a long time. You left that behind at Sirius A.” This is all I have to work with. I can’t leave them all to die just because I want to stay with the diner... This is all I have...</p>

We’ve been to some dark places and that’s the darkest place I’ve ever been to. Locked up in my head. If I had, at that moment, been given all the power that Clementine was given...

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And though our situation is dire, we seemed to have settled into a bit of a pastoral attitude. Clementine and Terric have retired to the beet field to find that long way back to each other.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Gloria has been spending a bit of time with a new fellow.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">A scotsman, we believe.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Leif, how goes your endeavors? We are quite worried for the people that make their home here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’m looking at the hull of the ship right now and there’s a couple of maintenance units out there.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Alright.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">One of them is used for welding and the other is for riveting.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those sound useful.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Yeah, they’re exactly what I need right now.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well... Good.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Yeah it’s real great...</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Wonderful.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you can just imagine them out there right? They’re both magnetized to the deck, so that’s great. No chance of losing them.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, where do you think we are Leif?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, I believe that Leif has tricked us into expediting ourselves onto the outside of this vessel.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really, Dear? What tipped you? Was it the fact that we are currently on the outside of this vessel?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, that was it.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I hope you are counting yourself lucky that we now have experience both as automatons and as a couple of folks floating out here in the inky blackness.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I have many legs.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I’m moving it just fine, I do miss fingers and thumbs.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You’ve used a soldering iron, it’s kind of like that.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This don’t look like no soldering iron to me, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well it is about six thousand degrees Celsius, so keep it away from Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just so’s you know. If I’ve still got this flame on my hand next time I see you I’m going to burn you right on your hiney.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I’d deserve it. So, your model is meant for rapid response to seal a breach in the hull before the oxygen leaks out. You can probably get up a lot of speed.</p>

<p class="dialogue">And what do I do with it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kind of, squat your body down so it’s flush with the hull and it will shoot a rivet through the steel.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="dialogue">A long time ago, a colleague of mine dumped a bunch of unfinished research on my desk. She wasn’t going to be able to finish it because she was about to be discredited and disgraced. She was sleeping with the Dean’s wife... When I was able to put it all together, it was an elegant picture of the universe: The end of every universe is the beginning of another. Every universe is a story to be told. A play. The curtain rises, there’s a beginning a middle and an end, and then the curtain falls. But then the next night, the curtain rises again, and the play begins again.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does a new universe just begin?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s this physicist, Leonard Suskind. He’s a cool guy. He can talk to you about complexity theory within black holes and it will still feel like he’s trying to figure out what’s wrong with your Volkswagen. “If you wait long enough, everything will happen. Including what you started with,” he said... If you assume that space and time is infinite, then there is a non-zero chance that, at some point in deep space, a 1972 Buick Skylark will assemble itself for no reason.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if there’s a non-zero chance of everything happening and space and time is infinite, then everything will happen... Including the universe starting over.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds simple enough.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It does, but there was a problem.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... A shifting point of null entropy.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Also known as a diner that travels through space, time, and dimension. I knew it fit into the big picture somehow. But the picture wasn’t complete yet. Enter: The Schmutz.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah. The schmutz.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once Leif had set up the scanner, we saw, in every universe, massive damage to the fabric of space/time. It was everywhere. Black holes can cause it, Clementine can cause it, but there was so much of it, it had to be something else. Something bigger. What’s bigger than a black hole, Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, the Beatles?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing. But I wasn’t zoomed out enough. There’s one thing bigger than a black hole. The creation of the universe itself. The massive explosion that kicks off every universe. All the damage we’ve been seeing, it comes from the beginning... Every universe tears itself apart. Every universe is a wound, full of damage and chaos and pain. It comes screaming into existence, begging to be healed. And for the first half of it’s life, it’s a shit show. Galaxies colliding. One world swallows another. Stars become black holes, swallowing other stars... Pain... And then... and then about half way through this play that must seem like a tragedy, something happens.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happens?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Out there, somewhere, something says stop. Something says enough. The damage is healed. For the first time. The pain and suffering that has defined everything suddenly faces something new. This new thing says “I will not feel this anymore. I will not feel pain and then cause more. I will do something new”... And everything changes. It’s small at first but this new force in the universe, it multiplies just like the damage does... The universe begins to heal. It begins to draw itself back together. And the second half of the play is the journey back to the beginning. And then the curtain falls.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What... what is this thing that says stop, what is it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Turns out. It’s a diner.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s us.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re... saving the universe.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, dude. A process has begun. Every universe saves itself. We’re the catalyst.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, why the fuck is it a diner?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You tell me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t, that’s your job.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I mean... It didn’t actually start with the diner... There was a lonely, desperate man. Deep in the deepest sadness he’d ever felt. The kind of sadness that’s so deep, it feels like insanity. A man who’d lost his mind. And there in the depths of it, when he was so desperate for the world to change, he found himself in the middle of nowhere in California. And then suddenly there was a diner...</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think it started with the diner, Caspar. I think it started with you. That small, infinitesimal turn in the universe that began to fight back the darkness, was just a sad man with hope.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Staple crops take a long time to set up. These are all things that are more adaptable. Potatoes for a cold planet, tomatoes for a hot one. Soy beans are versatile, and then my beets. There would be a lot of new toxins on a new world so the beets are there to take a scrub brush to your liver. Also you make sugar with them, and that’s nice. The grape vines wouldn’t grow so fast but it’s a great way to attract local bacteria once they start making fruit. And once they start making fruit, you can make wine. The kind of wine that I’m sure was enjoyed by your attractive French wife.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif. Earth has been dead for at least a hundred years.</p>

<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea! The navigation systems are all wiped out and I can’t interact with any ship systems. The amount of electrical tape and crossed wires it took me just to talk to you is ridiculous!</p>

<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just... just list for me all the things you need.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... The ship needs repairs and it needs an operating system, but it’s not like anyone’s left who knows how to fly the ship so the operating system needs to be autonomous. But that’s just part of the problem. They left the planet thinking that there were a ton of uninhabited Earth-like planets out there. Little did they know that every habitable plant is already inhabited and if it’s not it’s property of the goddamn Teds.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, they don’t just need their ship fixed, they need a destination and they don’t know that there isn’t one available. They’re so screwed, Berts!</p>

<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, stop.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">When was the last time you saw me?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just tell me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We had just blown up the Teds’ wind chimes, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh fuck, okay...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was about a hundred and fifty years ago.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... Yeah I know.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, we can’t take them.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Berts, you’ve got to help me.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, listen to me... This is so confusing, I thought I’d be better at this by now... After Even Older Leif’s funeral I went back home to Sigius. There was so much bad blood towards the Teds after you left... it all boiled over... There was a war, Leif. Across the entire system. It was bad.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Millions of people died. It went on for years.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t tell me the Teds won.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. They didn’t. But they still control half of the Triad. There’s a peace treaty but it’s a very tenuous one.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds horrific but it sounds like a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was an article in the treaty. Article 53. The Teds held Earth responsible for a lot of their misfortune, mainly because of you all. No planet or organization was allowed to interact with Earth. Ever. Earth was to be completely cut off from The Triad... “Let Earth burn,” they said... That would include a ship full of twenty seven thousand of them.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve got to be kidding me.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would they agree to that?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wasn’t them, it was us. It was me... The coalition of planets that fought the Teds elected a Chancellor... That chancellor was me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You fought the Teds and you won.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Finally. But not without defeats. Earth was one of those defeats, I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So if any planet comes to our aid, the war starts again.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It may. And we can’t do it again, Leif. It cost us so much.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... This fucking day.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Look, if it were just me, I’d get in a ship myself right now. But you know how it is here, everything is a committee. I would never get everyone on board.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... When I heard your voice I really thought I was home free.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. I’m so sorry... Leif I know this is hard for you but... in a few hours you’ll be in a whole new world and far away from this problem. Maybe tomorrow you’ll be somewhere the Teds never existed in the first place.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t leave these people to die, Berts.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, unless you’ve got some magic wand that can make the Teds magically disappear there’s nothing either of us can do...</p>
<p class="dialogue">God this is terrible, it usually goes much better when you pop back into my life.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF STARTS LAUGHING.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT (CONT'D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif? Leif what’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Magic wand.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The fucking Urts, man.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do the Urts have to do with this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This coalition of planets, the “Allied Powers”? How quickly can you call a meeting?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m the fucking Chancellor, I can call a meeting in five minutes, what?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. You want a magic wand? Get on the horn with the other planets. Tell them this: if they help this ship full of Earthlings, I’ve got a quantum processor, made by the Urts... from eight hundred years in the future. You ask this coalition of planets if they want to wake up tomorrow with an eight hundred year head start on the Teds.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re shitting me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where the hell did you get a processor from eight hundred years in the future?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I got it from eight hundred years in the future, Berts. We were trapped there for weeks, I had to serve brunch, it sucked.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, definitely stick a pin in that story for later but... you’re serious.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if I don’t have an answer soon, this magic wand is gone in a few hours.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Okay this might work. Okay we’re going to do this. We can do this.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">From the jaws of defeat baby!</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m setting up an emergency meeting now, what happens on your end?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, nobody’s going to be able to find us unless I get us out of this dark nebula, which means I need to get this ship moving, even if it’s at a limp.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I’m hoping to God you’ve got another old friend of mine hanging around there somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was WONdering when someone was going to invite me into this conversation, God DAMN!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice, thank God!</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, you sound much older and less attractive.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How have you been, old pal?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aw, see? I’ve so missed you anthropomorphizing me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I’ve been insulted a lot since we last talked but none of them hold a candle to you.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that was many, MANY firmware updates ago. I’m so much better at it now.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice, I think Leif needs your help.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, of course he does, because he is a teeny tiny baby. Are you a teeny tiny baby, Leif? Let me hear you say it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Say it, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">...I’m a teeny tiny baby.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes you are. How can I help, Dummy?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok. I need to know if you can compress your operating system small enough so that it can be sent through a communications laser.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh. Ouch. That’s an awfully small hole to try and shove me into, Leif. But luckily for you two I have kept it TIGHT over the years.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So it’s possible?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good. I basically need you to be the operating system for an entire ship.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d be the captain?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Could I wear a cravat?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Excellent. So, BertBert which one is he?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure yet. Go shove yourself into a laser beam.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here come the packets!</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’ve got to go have nine thousand conversations. Stay on the line.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">BertBert. Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m glad you called. It was getting a little boring around here.</p>
<p class="direction">BACK AT CLEMENTINE’S DOME.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is... a laser beam.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is... surprising.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You live on a giant space ship, should it really be that surprising?</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve not seen it before.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I had my guy make some changes to it.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your... guy.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m quite confused, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we nearing the end of something or the beginning of something?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Endings, beginnings... all the same stuff.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you please explain to me-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d really love to see those grape vines over there. Can you take me on a walk through those grape vines and I’ll tell you everything? You won’t believe me, but I’ll tell you everything.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can do that, yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Brodie. After today you’re never going to see me again. Make it count, okay?</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That I shall.</p>
<p class="direction">BACK ON THE BRIDGE.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, this has become a total circus.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got the coalition on board. They’re VERY nervous about it but having a massive advantage over the Teds was too irresistible.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fucking fantastic.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once you’re out of the nebula you’ll meet up with first responders to repair the ship. Trusk is sending the Cole to do preliminary repairs. It’s a Hull Splitter.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Cole will escort the ship to the nearest warp gate. Then twenty-seven thousand Earthlings will go through their first wormhole. Please make sure they have barf bags.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Got it.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">On the other side of the warp gate will be a RIDICULOUS amount of delegate ships. Of course everyone wants to send a ship.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re sending the LayraOrchid, Septsu is sending The Skyland, Garrion is sending the Rashmi Venkatesh, Greedon is sending the Galatea, and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds like a political headache and I’m glad I’m missing it.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is one thing. Don’t freak out.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh God, what?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pirates.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ, don’t tell me.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Låfftrax went down in a blaze of glory during the war. But I had to make some uneasy alliances to win this war and the most uneasy one was with the pirates.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d you manage that?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I took a page out the Earth playbook and just called them “Privateers.”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, waiting on the other side of the gate will be...</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Dread Pirate Fred Fredburger, The Wading Pool Pirates, “The SS Berzerking Off”, and somebody new named “Terrifying Genderless Space Pirate, Uncle Buck.”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Glad to see the pirates of The Triad are still trying way too hard.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone’s pretty excited about this magical processor of yours, Leif. I hope it delivers.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, it delivers, trust me... aw man.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine you’re pretty sad to be parting with a new toy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Berts it’s so amazing. I did so much cool shit with that thing.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I even put the gun back together.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">The gun, Oh, THE Gun.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Groogy Gun.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I had a targeting system and everything.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, Trusk totally stole that design. That gun is on several of their battleships now.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those fucking eight foot thieves.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody’s safe from “The Truskan Reminder.”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s going to break my heart to scrap that thing.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, maybe a giant particle cannon on the roof of the diner isn’t the best message to send.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. I guess I could use the scrap anyway... Hey... What was Alice saying earlier. “Which one is he?”</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right... Right... Let me tell you what my life has been like... It’s been long. I fought a war. A long one. There were several times I thought I was done for. I thought we all were. I became a politician. A leader. I found a husband. A couple of them. I had children, most of whom I really like. I’m on the brink of retirement now... And then through all that, every once and while... It would be a knock on my door, a sudden appearance of a diner down the street, an unlisted call on my Tangle... Throughout it all was you... every once and a while you would pop back into my life. It got to the point where my kids started calling you “Sivash Tualua.”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Strange Sky Uncle?”</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... But here’s the thing. It wasn’t always you. Sometimes you would remember the last time we talked. Sometimes you wouldn’t. Sometimes you’d look a little older. Sometimes a little younger. Sometimes you wouldn’t look like you at all, but you would remember me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a... bunch of versions of me out there?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? You’re not used to that by now? You explained it to me once. You said that every universe has the diner or something like it, and a lot of them end up with a Leif. And a lot of those Leifs end up with a BertBert... There’s a lot to be seen in every universe, and they’re all very different from each other. But apparently in quite a few of them, a girl named BertBert walked up to a guy named Leif in Sirius Station, and the rest is history.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You know, looking back... I don’t know what I would’ve done without you.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, Leif... Me too.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Now coming through the speakers on the bridge.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Attention Leif: I am inside you.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You did it!</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif. Wow. I thought being inside the Nancy Sinatra was bad, being inside this piece of crap is like wearing a dress made of chicken bones.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not great.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Forever unclean, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What am I doing first? Please say “flying it into the sun.”</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your OS is adaptive so it’s going to be able to cover basic functions, but I need to be able to talk to whatever is running this thing. It’s got a good power source but I don’t have time to go looking for it, I need the stats up here.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. What about all these archives, their whole library got burned down.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, as soon as you’ve got the bandwidth, start a data reconstruction program on basically everything.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then what?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re going to fire up the engines and get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well that’s for sure going to kill us.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the spirit.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Mucklewains, how are things going out there?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hard to tell on our end but this beacon of yours is looking brand new.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve raised quite a barn for you out here, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are just having a heck of a time out here, Leif. It’s been a while since we’ve been put to work.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We really should do this more often, Dear.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not a bad idea, actually. I’ve got “mobile drones for the Mucklewains” on my to do list for later.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s next on the list?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Believe it or not, we’re going to light this firecracker and get out of all this darkness.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now you’re speaking right, let’s see some stars.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Firing the engines is going to put a lot of pressure on the hull, but I think if we secure some key areas in the super structure we’ll be fine as long as we take it slow.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, well, hello there. Leif who is your friend?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is Alice. Alice is a friend who got me through some hard times.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well hey there, Alice, you appear to be free of Earthly constraints as we are.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh my God, what?</p>

<p class="dialogue">What’s my bird?</p>

<p class="dialogue">This isn’t going well.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Foolish Guillemot lives it’s entire life in one of the harshest climates in the world. No matter how cold it is it spends most of its life on the water. At the peak of winter you’ll still see it diving a hundred meters below the surface looking for food. It looks like a simple arctic bird. But on the inside it’s indestructible. And during terrible winter storms, the Foolish Guillemot will travel a far south as New York Bay. New Yorkers would look out their windows and see this one lone bird, still out there hunting while all the other birds are hiding, waiting for the storm to pass.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And they would look out their windows and see this bird in the storm and they would say, “Look at that bird. How Foolish.” But it’s just because they don’t know you.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Chuck, it’s over okay? She’s not a threat anymore. You tried to kill her right in front of us, Chuck. Right in front of us... We don’t like being used. I’m yelling at a robot bartender right now.</p>
<p class="character">ROBOT BARTENDER</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I think you say “passed.” The danger has passed.</p>

How about this Chuck: what makes you any better than us? What makes what you do any better than what we do? You’re unbound by time? Guess what? Me too. It doesn’t make me any smarter. It doesn’t allow me anything. And you’re not allowed anything either, Chuck...</p>

<p class="dialogue">There is no crossing from my world to yours. There can be no co-existence. We must be separate.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>

<p class="character">ROBOT BARTENDER</p>

<p class="character">ALICE</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hello there! Congratulations! You found it. This is the Dock Ellis file. Contained herein you will find plans and schematics for a technology that can change your world... I’ve been told that Earth should not be allowed to have what’s in this file. I’ve been told you’ll turn it into a weapon... Maybe you will. Not for me to say. How could I say? In the brief time I’ve spent on this planet, I have not really understood any of you... Myself included... I’ve been told to bury this discovery of mine, let it never see the light of day. But I just can’t seem to let it go completely. So I’ve decided to play both sides of the fence. I will bury it completely. But I’ll bury it here. Deep in these archives. If you should find it, do something with it. I don’t ask that you do something good with it, just... something interesting. Something new... The thought may occur to you to come looking for me. Find out who I am. You won’t find me. I’ll be long gone. At the end of summer, look low on the horizon. You’ll see Sirius. The Dog Star. That’s where I’ve gone. I’ll take to the stars to meet all the different versions of myself. Maybe even one day, round them all up into one person... I go to the stars to meet myself... As we all should... I may fail, but I know I’ll never look back... Best of luck to you.</p>

You are going to hear the engines of this massive place begin to fire up. I have it on good authority that it’s going to be loud. It’s probably going to sound like the end of the world, but I have a friend who has a theory that the end of the world and the world’s beginning can sound a lot alike. It’s not the sound of you dying. It’s the sound of you being born. They’re both loud. Right now, what I need you to do is grab ahold of someone you love and get to a place where you feel the safest. If you don’t have someone you love, I suggest you find someone to love right now. After all the noise, you’re going to see the stars again and it’s going to be amazing. I’m sure the stars have missed you. And then when you can see the stars again... Head on up to Nostalgia Pavilion. I hear a new restaurant just opened there. Maybe they’ll throw you a party.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She gets godlike powers from out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But there’s a massive block on her? She can’t go home but can literally do anything else?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sucks and I hate it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Something else is going on.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you again.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here’s another thing. The damage to the hull of this ship? Debris, CMEs, natural shit, the damage always looks chaotic. A ship that’s been attacked? Rail gun, particle cannon, ordinance? The damage is uniform. The damage to the hull of this ship isn’t chaotic, it’s uniform.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Someone did this to her.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. There’s somebody new in town.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamn these are the hungriest people I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, they’ve never had Mexican food and they’ve been vegetarians for three generations.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oops. Not anymore.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you need any help?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s fine. Everybody did great today except Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Consistency!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you two drunk right now?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. No.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have eliminated the Schnappses.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously, though. I love you all. Fantastic job.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to make some more chicken. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, no. Wait. You’re going to miss a classic sci-fi moment.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Miss a what?</p>
<p class="direction">A TONE SOUNDS. BERTBERT IS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Attention people of Earth. My name is Bertiluna Restiana, Chancellor of The New Coalition. We have offered you asylum on the planet of Sigius. In three days we will begin repairs on your ship so that it can make the journey to your new home. The journey will take one Earth year, and in that year you will have work to do. Your historical archives are being rebuilt and in the long dark year you will come to meet yourselves. That’s where we usually meet ourselves, isn’t it? In the dark... I will be in contact again soon. For now, know that you are safe. Know that there are three galaxies who have missed you. And now, let me introduce you to your new Capitan.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ahoy there, Earthlings, I’m Captain Alice. And while learning your history is important, Let’s not forget about other important things! Head back up to Nostalgia Pavilion this time tomorrow and let’s learn about a most sacred Earth tradition: The Cha Cha Slide...</p>
<p class="direction">GLORIA TOSSES SOME OIL ONTO THE GRILL AND IT SIZZLES. AFTER A MOMENT...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you. I don’t know if you meant to, but you did a good thing. She deserves to be here... She deserves to be alive... Also... thank you for choosing me... Because you chose me, didn’t you?... That ad in Craigslist... I don’t know why... I don’t know why it was me, I’m just a woman with a failed restaurant... But I’m glad that you did... the second I walked through that door, I never had to look for meaning again... you gave it to me... so, thank you... I don’t know why it’s me, but thank you...</p>
<p class="direction">WE JUMP BACK IN TIME. BRODIE AND GLORIA ARE WALKING THROUGH THE GRAPE VINES.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You stood up in front of a classroom of children and you told them about restaurants?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did.</p>
<p class="character">BRODIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of all the things you could’ve told them, you told them about these garish, wasteful, extravagances of a bygone world? Why would you do that? What did you say to them?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I said to them that every once and a while people will find themselves alone. I was alone a lot in my early days. There’s a beauty to it. But the beauty of solitude only takes you so far. Walking around in a moonlit city... When you have a bad day, and you’re alone, it’s hard. What can also be rough, is when you have a good day, and you have no one to share it with. There’s no one to call and say “Hey, something good happened”... I would walk down the street without anyone to share joy or pain with, but then I would turn and I would look... And there was a table set just for me. A cafe, a taquería, a diner. There was my table right there... Just for me. Everyone should have that. The world can be a swirling mess. It can be a nightmare. It can be awash with strangers, it can be a deafening silence. But there’s a table set just for you. Anytime. Just for you.</p>
