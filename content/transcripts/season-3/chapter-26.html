<p class="dialogue">Great. Let’s get it going.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to go check for him one more time.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, the reason why Caspar is going off on his own between shifts is because you won’t leave him alone.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I don’t understand that so I’m choosing to ignore it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Good luck, then.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE OUT INTO THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Morning, Mucklewains.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Morning to you, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We seem to have yet another ship full of visitors approaching.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, they don’t seem to let up, do they?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m still a bit confused by this ritual.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a combination of breakfast and lunch. It started because people wanted to get together either after church or before their hangover wore off.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do these people get anything done for the rest of the day after dinking fancy champagne in the late morning?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They don’t. Effie, do you have any more feelings about where we are?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Gloria. It’s all the same feelings. We have been put in a place of punishment. Though I hardly see how it’s such a punishment.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trust me, it is. Clementine put us in the ultimate place of punishment for a restaurant: a never ending brunch.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME. A MASSIVE CROWD MOVES INTO THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right this way, everyone. My group, this way, everyone take a seat anywhere. There are booths, tables, and stools here. Please stay away from that booth over there, the one with all the books and things on it, okay? Thank you. Hi, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Quin.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Another big group!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is!</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I remembered about that one booth this time, did you notice?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I saw, thank you. I’ll start bringing out some food soon.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Quin. Okay, everyone. Who wants champagne?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good morning to all. I’m Zebulon Mucklewain here with my wife, Effie.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, y’all.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let us begin this glorious morning with equally glorious noise. Here is the Shannon Quartet with “Christ Arose”.</p>
<p class="direction">SONG: THE SHANNON QUARTET, “CHRIST AROSE”.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love your AI so much. It’s got so much personality.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We like it.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And where is the music from again?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Earth.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird. Never heard of it. (Addressing the crowd.) Okay, everyone, I hope you’re enjoying your Champagne. We’re going to have some food and then after that we’re going to leave for our first arial tour of this mysterious and wondrous planet.</p>
<p class="direction">LIGHT APPLAUSE.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Champagne for you, Quin.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh. Thank you, Leif. (Addressing the crowd.) Everyone, while we’re waiting for food, do take a look at the tour information I just sent to your DATs, it has all we’ve been able to learn about this mysterious uncharted place we find ourselves in.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know Clementine meant this to be a punishment, but at least the people are nice.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I’m having a hard time getting this into my head. How can this Quin be speaking our language but never have heard of our homeland?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s weird, right? I’m assuming we’re pretty far in the relative future right now. In my day, English got adopted across a few galaxies because they liked watching our television so much. I guess we’re so far in the future that Earth’s been forgotten but our language still survives somehow.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">How could our world in it’s entirety be forgotten?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">People always forget more than they remember. I guess that can apply to a whole damn planet.</p>
<p class="direction">BACK DOOR OPENS.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s not by those trees back there, I’m going to go check by the water’s edge, I’ve seen him there a few times.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, you really need to give him some space.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? I should give him just enough space to do something stupid? Are we talking about the same guy?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava-</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just let her burn herself out. Caspar will be back soon and then she’ll relax. I mean, she won’t relax, she’ll keep hounding him, but she’ll leave us alone at least.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s afraid, y’all.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And while we’re on the subject, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel that we’re speaking quite often of the purgatory we find ourselves in and not the reason we’ve been placed here.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wouldn’t have made sense for us to jump right into it, Zeb.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I agree, Gloria. Clementine has challenged us as Satan challenged Christ in the desert. The temptations she presented are very real and each should be confronted in our own way.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think Clementine is Satan, Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She certainly is not. But neither are any of us Christ.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When Caspar’s ready to talk about it, we’ll all talk about it, okay?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Understood.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe that’s fair.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Leif, can you come help me make one million scrambled eggs please?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, sure.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, dear.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe it’s time.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t approve of this plan, Zebulon.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there are parts of myself that do not approve of it either. But our friends are in a bad way, and if there is anything I can do to shake us loose from this particular spider’s web then I feel I must.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well, Dearest. Go with God and go with my love.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">As I always do.</p>
<p class="direction">THE SOUND OF A WHOLE LOT OF SCRAMBLED EGGS BEING MADE.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you suppose their fascination is with this planet?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you look out over the bay you can see the ruins of something. There was a big city here a long time ago, but it looks like they have no record of it. People like lost civilizations. They like the mystery. Everyone can come here and drink champagne and be amateur archaeologists; take a tour of the ruins.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t get it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Drinking champagne and looking at ruins is basically the entire economy of Greece. Just imagine that on a planetary scale.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you think happened to the people who lived here?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Could be anything. Plague, war, hell it could’ve just been the slightest change in their sun’s behavior that wiped them out.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you still have no idea where we are?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. I thought I would try and triangulate our positions using constellations but the cloud cover in this place is constant. I can’t get a good look.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need to have a meeting before the meeting.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar’s going to come back at some point and we’re all going to have to have a big talk. But I think we need to talk before we talk.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Let’s do it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve been making plans, haven’t you?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe. A little bit.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What have you got?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not much. But I know Clementine can’t keep us here forever.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If she could keep us here forever then she would just keep us here forever. We’d be done. But instead she made us all an offer. Tried to buy us off.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think eventually the diner’s going to figure out a way to slither out of this trap she put us in.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’ll just find us again.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the question is: what can we do between the diner escaping and her finding us again?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what can we do?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can hope that we have enough time to for me to build a quantum computer. I build the computer, fabricate the time crystal and then we can trap her.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then we’re trapped inside the diner with a murderous super-villain.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. I’m working on that, too.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s thin but it’s something.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what I keep telling myself.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you think she’s able to do all this? I tried asking Ava but she started saying things that didn’t even sound like words.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know and I don’t care. That’s the difference between Ava and me.</p>
<p class="dialogue">A long time ago at the edge of a map there would just be an arrow and some calligraphy saying “Here be Dragons”. A guy like me sees that and thinks “Well fuck that, I’m not going over there, there’s a dragon over there. The world is big enough.” Someone like Ava needs to see the dragon. Warnings are advertisements to her.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even if it means getting eaten by a dragon?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, even if that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Clementine made us an offer, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I want you to know that I wouldn’t judge you if-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria. Fuck her offer. Maybe this decision is easier for me than it is for all of you, but I know what my answer is. This place changed me. You, Effie, Zebulon, Caspar, Ava, all the people we’ve met. I’m different now. And she offers to send me back to before all that happened? Fuck that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been in worse spots than this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. We’ll be alright.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... then I guess we just wait for Caspar while you keep making plans.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds good.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take this tray of scrambled eggs out there, okay?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF PICKS UP THE TRAY OF SCRAMBLED EGGS.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Gloria?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The radio’s gone.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Hey Quin?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, what’s up?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our radio is gone.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah, that guy took it. The one that never talks?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar took the radio?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is he doing?</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s not down by the water, he’s not under the tree, he’s not anywhere. He’s gone.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">He can’t just vaporize, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do we know that? Maybe he clicked his heels together three times and Clementine whisked him away back to Kansas.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I doubt it works that way.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t know how it works.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well wherever he is, he took the radio.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did he take the radio? He’s never done that before.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, relax. I’m sure he’s around here somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop saying that.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, should I have said something?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go sell someone a time share.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s a time share?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Quin, give us a minute, okay?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have to be a united front. Clementine made her little offer and if Caspar takes the offer then the two of you are going to fold like a card table, I know it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks for the vote of confidence.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then it’s all over. Then what? Caspar is caving, I can feel it. We have to find him.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">He may surprise you, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That man has never surprised me. He’s as predictable as a rom com.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, I know you don’t want Caspar to go-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This isn’t about him! It’s not about him, it’s about everything. He can’t cave. It’s all over if he caves, it’s not about him.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, fine, it’s not about him. What do you want us to do?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I want everyone to agree with me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, we’re not going to do that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I’ve known Caspar longer than any of you. He’s not a rom com, he can surprise you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So that’s it? We’re just going to wait patiently while the whole thing unravels?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The whole thing is not unravelling.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe we should trust him?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, should we? He loaded me into a tin can and shoved me into deep space, you want me to trust that guy?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, how about some empathy?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can’t know what it’s like to get an offer like this. It’s probably fucked him up pretty bad.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fucked me up pretty bad.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you’re still here and he’s not.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want us to form a search party?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did he take the radio?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Took the radio where?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t believe you two are just sitting there.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, maybe he took the radio because he wanted to talk to someone who wasn’t constantly hounding him. You’re upset he’s gone? He’s gone because of you. Maybe if you relax he’ll feel comfortable coming back?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t give me that zen master crap.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine, how about this: Go back to your fucking booth and stop annoying the shit out of everyone, you’re not helping, you’re making it worse.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... This is a mistake.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’ve got some arial drones now, you want me to search the area?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Us finding him isn’t going to change anything. He’s going through something and he needs some space.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes you need some space and sometimes you need someone to come find you.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava’s found him about twenty times now.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes you need the right person to find you.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we don’t know where he is anyway.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where would you go?</p>

Ava explained at one point that this land is in an eternal December but the words she used were of the sort that made me want to quickly think about something else... We’ll never want for a Christmas tree will we?... We should really do ourselves a favor with Christmas this year, shouldn’t we?... Doesn’t that sound nice, Caspar?</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what I just said.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s praying, Caspar, he is praying and he’s secluded.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has he ever done this before? I don’t remember him ever doing this before.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we’ve never been stuck in this particular patch of mud before, have we Caspar? Zebulon is convinced that reaching out in prayer is the best way forward.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like it.</p>

<p class="dialogue">And I guess you’ve come down here to get me to stop avoiding the elephant in the room.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Caspar, I was doing the same thing. We were both avoiding it. You went and hid somewhere and I buried myself in this endless brunch that’s going on up there. We were doing the same thing in different ways.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does that mean we’re done avoiding it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great... With a wave of my hand I could kill you all. That’s what she said.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a very clear memory of that moment.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why this, then? Why did she do this to us?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because death is not defeat. And she needs to defeat us.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel pretty defeated.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Feeling down on yourself isn’t defeat, Caspar. This woman is tearing a path through all creation with reckless abandon, but she ain’t stupid. Somewhere deep down she knows she’s wrong and she’s desperate for someone to tell her she isn’t. And then here we come, telling her to stop, adding to the doubt she feels. If she were to wave that mighty hand and send us to the great beyond, out voices would still be in her head. The only way to get the voices out is to change our minds. Get us to come over to her side. However... Before I get too far down on that particular path of righteousness, I should say another thing... Zebulon and I love you both very much. We can get to these places in our lives where we feel as though there’s no escape. Places we inhabit out of obligation and duty, or fear and anger. We find ourselves trapped because we’re afraid of what others will say or how they’ll judge us should we leave. A promise should not be a prison, it does a great disservice to yourself and to those you have promised to. It becomes dishonest.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s important to keep your promises, Effie.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I... Well, I’m not certain of that, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It depends on the promise, doesn’t it? Before his conversion, the Apostle Paul had sworn to persecute christians and drive them from their faith. When the lord appeared to Paul and he experienced his great conversion on that road to Damascus, should he have kept his promise to persecute those he now cared for? Was the promise to be kept then? What I mean to say, to the both of you, is that we do not feel we are owed anything from you. And we wish for you both to travel the path you feel God has intended for you.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not taking the deal, Effie.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, thank the Lord. Hoo-wee!</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know I’m not taking the deal?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you wouldn’t. All this moping and hiding you’re doing is because you know you won’t take the deal... And it really sucks.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It does.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The entire time we’ve been stuck here I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Teds threatened to freeze me in a block of chemical ice but for some reason this was worse. It shouldn’t be. I mean, looked at in the right light, Clementine is actually trying to do something nice for us. Something impossibly kind, something anyone would  be grateful for. But it doesn’t feel that way.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, what she did was terrible and evil. There’s nothing kind about it... It took years before I was over the death of my parents. Years.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And still to this day, every once in a while I’m back at square one, like I lost them yesterday. I had to read books about it and they were not good books. People try and sell you the stages of grief like it’s a video game. Like you’re unlocking achievements or something. That’s not how it is. One day it’s stage three, one day it’s stage five. After months at stage five you wake up one morning back at stage one... It’s a state of being, not a process. All of that work I had to do to get over it started at one place: acceptance. They were gone and there was nothing I could do about it... She took that away from me. I’m still never going to see my parents again, but in making this offer to us, she made that my fault. She made it my choice. It’s a horrible thing to do to someone.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">God, that really is true.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="direction">THEY KEEP WALKING.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What made you decide to stay?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Back when I was talking to my mom she said I would be a good parent. It was weird to hear. But I think she’s probably right. I’m a different person now. It’s literally been a century. So, it was tempting. Not just because of that but because... 173 years, Ava. It’s oppressive, all this time. All those years I was alive, it builds up. I didn’t even know. I wasn’t even looking at it. Suddenly I turned and there were all those years behind me. It builds up like rust. Deposits at the mouth of a river. We’re just not built to hold that much time in us. I’m past my due date. And the temptation is always there to find a nice spot, lay down in the grass. Let the years rush at me. And here’s Clementine offering me that, and my son. It was tempting. I may be worthy of being his dad now. But to get back to him I’d have to... I’d have to screw you over, which would mean I’m not the guy who’s worthy of seeing him again. To be the guy I should’ve been for him, I have to choose to not be around him. Going out of my way to see him again, fucking things up in the process, that would be about me not about him. She offered me a way to make it all never have happened in the first place... But the thing is, it did happen. And I could ignore all that. Choose whatever reality I want and leave all this behind me. Or I could not do that. I could just say no. No to what I’ve done. What people have done to me. What I’ve been through. The trauma, the heartache, the mistakes, and I could look at it all, all that has built up over years and years and years and I could just say: Enough. Enough of looking back. Enough of taking stock. Enough pain, enough pity, enough of so much of the garbage that we define ourselves with and just point at the horizon and say “That way”. Ever forward. These things are all a part of me but I won’t live in them or try and rid myself of them. Ever forward. “That way”. “There’s no turning back the clock” said the man in the Time Machine. I could just do that.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Besides. Gloria says that when we find this woman she is going to punch her right in her titty. And I think we’ve all, as a family, earned the right to see that.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, they have just recently uncovered a time capsule in this area. It was encased in titanium and has a bunch of information about the planet. We’re doing a big presentation on it today. They’re sending a script to my DAT right now. I’m performing today!</p>

<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Power source? Um... You know I’m not sure. When everything transferred over to Urt Boxes, ships didn’t need reactors anymore, but I don’t know where the power comes from now. Who knows how anything works these days?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Urt Box?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Everything switched over to Urt Boxes when I was a kid. It changed the whole system. They say it’s a new Golden Age.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s an Urt Box?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a processor. I mean calling it a processor is kind of... Something about entanglement and photons.</p>

<p class="dialogue">A quantum computer?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Right this way everyone! We’ve got a special treat for you called Brunch!</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m okay. Hey, you know what I discovered?</p>

<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This huge body of water we’re on the edge of?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about it?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look at us. You’re from California, I spent most of my life in California, and neither of us saw it. Look.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh shit.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Do you see it now?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Good point... It’s weird that this changes nothing.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, we’re either trapped here or trapped in some other galactic sock drawer.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, I’ve had a bit of a revelation.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, really?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Remember that quantum computer I was saying was impossible to build?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are, I’m guessing, a thousand years in the future and every single one of those ships over there has a quantum computer in it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Are we about to do crimes?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are absolutely about to do crimes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I love crimes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you think Gloria’s going to mind?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria’s making stew for the K-Pop wolves right now, we don’t need to bother her with this.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re right. We don’t want her to feel guilt or shame or any of those emotions that normal humans feel.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh hey!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi, Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are the wolves?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were not talking about crimes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Look, desperate times, Gloria-</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif. You go jerk the guts out of one of them contraptions immediately and get us the heck out of this purgatory.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Will do.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do we need to create a distraction?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, Quin was telling me she’s about to do some sort of big presentation about “what happened to this mysterious planet we’re on”. Everyone should be focused on that, that’s when I’ll make my move.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh cool, we’re going to see how Earth was destroyed. I hate to be old school about this but I’m going to say thermonuclear war, what do we think?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. The clowns finally rise up and kill us all.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kind of glad Zebulon isn’t here to see us commit grand theft space auto.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, when the cat’s away.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Happy larceny!</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone, gather round, we have a very special presentation for you. Gloria, could we get some of that champagne for the group?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I got it.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks, Caspar.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m feeling a strong desire to spoil this and tell them exactly where they are.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I want to see how dumb they are.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">So. Everyone. The big news today is that there has been a HUGE discovery on our mysterious planet that sheds a lot of light on who lived here and what happened to them. And it all starts with a time capsule encased in titanium that was found not far from here.</p>
<p class="direction">OOHS AND AHHS FROM THE CROWD.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes! Very exciting. This time capsule contained comprehensive notes and even data files with video testimony on them, and today we are going to hear directly from the person who put this capsule in the ground so long ago.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This better not be some survivalist jackass.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can’t tell you much about this person but we can tell you that they were referred to as a “businesswoman” and “entrepreneur”.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I knew it, it’s Martha Stewart, nothing can kill that woman.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, let’s get right to it, shall we? Let me introduce you to... Tamara Oliver.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait...</p>
<p class="direction">A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN ACTIVATES.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. My name Tamara Oliver, and if you’re seeing this video it means you’ve found my capsule. Good, I’m glad. I’m feeling a little stupid putting it together.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s Tamara.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that the young lady from that Shopping Mall?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Plus about 40 years, yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is happening?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What I’ve been telling people is that I want to make these videos as a little retirement project, to leave something for future generations. But that is not my intended audience. What I’m not telling them is that these videos are meant for a very specific audience. I’m talking about my old friends at the diner. If anyone’s listening to this, I sure hope it’s y’all somehow. Let me start at the beginning...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we’re in the same timeline as the Mall Zombies right now?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shopzies.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A thousand years later, but yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we’re not calling them that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Didn’t you and Leif make a thing where you can tell if we’ve been to a universe before?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but I’ve been a little busy chasing you around the Moors, Heathcliff.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">These videos that Tamara made are very comprehensive, and they will all be available on everyone’s DAT right after the presentation, but to sum up: Tamara was making these videos specifically for a mysterious group that she constantly refers to as “her friends at the diner.” We imagine this is code for something but we’re not sure what.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The first several videos document what happened to Tamara after something she refers to as “The Shopzies.”</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamnit.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">After this incident Tamara went on to be a very successful “businesswoman” using something she called “the secret sauce.”</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The secret sauce?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I gave her stock tips from the future.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... And so there I was. I was a successful woman. I had money in the bank, I had three houses... not bad for a security guard from Ohio. The thing about getting rich is: you’ve got some time on your hands. That was new for me. I did some traveling, I worked with charities, shit I even played golf a few times. And then, one day, my rich ass found itself at an art auction. Me. I did NOT fit in. Surrounded by all these fancy people with a paddle in my hand that said number 73... And that’s when I saw her. Up on that auction block was a painting of a woman who’s face I recognized. And I bet you recognize it too.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have here an image of the painting Tamara is referring to. It’s called “Woman with Red Hair,” by an artist named Modigliani.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I definitely recognize that face.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">My word, is that Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tamara claims that the woman in this painting, that was painted long before she was born, is also a woman she met while she was a guard for something called a “Mall.” Tamara became obsessed with this woman, and spent the rest of her life trying to find out more about her. And Tamara believes what she discovered is the secret that we’ve all been wondering: How did the mysterious civilization of this mysterious planet come to an end? Believe it or not, Tamara believes that the demise of her entire civilization comes down to this woman.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No way.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">She calls her “Clementine.” Listen as Tamara explains...</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I knew she told me her name when I met her but I couldn’t put my finger on it. So I was fumbling around in the dark with this for a long time. Luckily someone finally invented Google, but even then I didn’t know where to go. The only thing I could search for was “notorious red head” which brought up... well I’m sure you can imagine what it brought up. But then I finally found an old blues song from 1929. It was a song about a small town that had suffered a train derailment, a flood, and a swarm of locusts all in the same year and each disaster coincided with a particular woman coming to town. The name of the song: “Hard Times Clementine.”</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">From that point on Tamara describes herself as “going down the rabbit hole.” We don’t know what that means exactly but we think it means to pass some sort of point of no return, to be consumed by something. Over her lifetime, Tamara assembled a mountain of evidence regarding the person she calls Clementine and, in doing so, documents a planet that is in a constant state of emergency. Today, we’ve come to call this constant state of emergency “The Polycrisis,” a confluence of many events that brings about a civilizations’s demise, and we’ve seen several examples of The Polycrisis on many planets throughout history. On your DATs right now just press on “A history of the Polycrisis across the System.” On this mysterious planet, the Polycrisis takes on a different form. A planet that was not just unlucky...</p>
<p class="dialogue">in fact you might even say “haunted”. Haunted by a beautiful red-headed woman named Clementine. Tamara’s research on the mysterious Clementine is exhaustive and spans massive amounts of time. She identifies Clementine in ancient artwork from a place called India, pictures from a riot in a place called Wales... I know it sounds very strange but I have to say, the evidence spanning massive amounts of time that Tamara has assembled is truly impressive. Tamara lays out case study after case study and then finally lands in the present day, where she insists the world has now been completely exhausted by the alleged encounters with Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t even know how to describe this world I’m living in now. It’s different than when I last saw you. It’s like we just can’t seem to catch a break. There’s a forest fire in California right now... it’s been burning for three years. They can’t put it out. A while back, half the population of Indonesia started speaking another language. And nobody knows what the language is. Siberia has started to thaw out and it has released some kind of virus that gives you amnesia. The world’s gotten pretty chaotic now, it’s getting harder and harder to look into these things. And that’s a shame because I was just getting on the trail of my favorite one yet. Something about a man in Jerusalem in the 14th century. A man named Terric of York... I swear to God, I have found evidence of this man, Terric of York, over the last 700 years. Same guy, 700 years... What the hell does that mean, y’all?! Is there another one?! The way people are migrating across the globe now, I may never know, I’ve lost track of him at this point! But I bet you’ll find evidence of a mysterious red head in all of these cases... But I think I’m too tired now to figure it all out. We all are. I think the one that may have done us all in was Ashley.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ashley the Asteroid?</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Half of the planet couldn’t see it, but I could. That thing was huge. Dark skies for three years but only for half of us. What the fuck?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Zombies and Ashley the Asteroid are in the same timeline?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God. It’s all in the same timeline.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">As I said, we’ve studied Polycrises on multiple planets. Across the system you can see civilizations that fall because they’ve been beset upon by multiple forces seemingly out of their control. One aspect that we’ve observed in a state of Polycrisis is when a civilization reaches a tipping point. “Going down the rabbit hole,” as Tamara would say. When a civilization is so degraded by the Polycrisis that they are headed for complete collapse, this fact is often kept a secret from the general populace and only circulated through societal elites and oligarchs. This planet seems to be no different. Luckily for Tamara, she was one of those societal elites because of her status as a venerated “Businesswoman.”</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A man named Kevin Batten wants of meet with me. He’s looking for investors. He says he’s got some way of saving the human race, but he wouldn’t give me any details. He said he’s got the backing of the Pearson family, though, and they’re even richer than me so I figure I’ll give it a shot. Hope springs eternal, right?... I don’t know why I made all of these videos for you all. I met you for one day, forty years ago.  But I still hope the message gets to you somehow. You may be the only ones who can do something about it.</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">As you can see around us, whatever the plan was to save the human race, appears to have failed. And, in the end, we have no way of corroborating any of the information Tamara presents to us. But as of right now, she is the sole ambassador of this lost civilization. A civilization haunted by a mysterious woman named Clementine.</p>

<p class="dialogue">So you got the thing?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes. The basic stuff not the quantum stuff. The standard model. The boring stuff. Inertia, thermodynamics. Every equation on this piece of paper represents an aspect of the universe.</p>

<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? That’s exciting, what is it?</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t want to spoil it. Do you mind if I get everyone outside?</p>
<p class="character">QUIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure, great. Surprises are fun!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aren’t they? (Addressing the crowd.) Attention, everyone. Before we start brunch service can we, real quick, get everyone to come outside? We’ve got a very special secret to reveal about this strange and mysterious planet.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re probably going to be wondering about this planet for the rest of your lives. So before we go I just wanted to say a few things. The planet you’re standing on is called Earth. We’re from there. I know that doesn’t make much sense, but it will in a minute. Caspar, introduce yourself.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Gloria what-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just wanted to introduce ourselves. I imagine you’re going to make a bunch of assumptions about our home in the years to come so I just wanted to say... We made mistakes, sure. We had more flaws that pluses. But I recommend you be kind when you judge us. Not because we deserve it, but because someday, far off in the future, someone will be having brunch on top of your bones too. How would you like them to speak of you?</p>
