<p class="direction">THE SOUND OF SPACE TIME FLYING BY. EVERYONE IS ON THE ROOF.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">“That’s a shame.” She said. “I’m going to have to do something about that. I’ll try to not make it hurt.” And then she vanished.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, way to de-escalate the situation, y’all.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We made her tea, we invited her into our home.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And let me guess, the entire time you were looking over the top of your glasses like a disapproving headmistress.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You mean the way I’m looking at you right now?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can someone explain to me how the three of you all ended up at your old house in Arkansas?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I did have a nice analogy about a grouse hunt.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would like to opt-out of the grouse hunt analogy.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">One time Effie told me that they seem to just fill up whatever container they’re put in. Somehow this woman, Clementine, put them in a container that looked like their past.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now opting in to the grouse hunt analogy.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Welcome back.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She said she’d “Learned a lot from the others.” The others being us. What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has she been spying on us or something?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">If she can travel through various timelines then she can poke around in all of our histories and we’d never know it. By meeting us in the past she just creates another timeline where we all once met a strange lady named Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great, so she’s got all kinds of dirt on us and we know nothing about her?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was confused when she spoke. She said she began as nothing and had to remake herself into her current form. Something about waking in a parking lot with no memory. Then her memories returning somehow. She seemed to regard herself as a sort of poorly made garment; one pull at an errant thread and she could unravel completely. She seems to regard us as an errant thread that could undo her, cause her to return to nothing before she had achieved her goal.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And this is when she started talking about her people?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. “We were just wandering in the darkness.” She said. “The stars had burnt out.” No light to be found anywhere. Whatever plight has befallen these people of hers, she believes she has the power to undo it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why doesn’t she just do that, then?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t believe she wishes to save her people, I believe she wishes to erase their plight completely.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s trying to remake her timeline.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, why doesn’t she just do THAT then?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How would you? It sounds like her entire civilization is screwed somehow, how do you undo that? It wouldn’t be one thing, it’d be a million things. How do you undo them all and how do you even know what to undo?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s impossible.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But she doesn’t know that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want to tell her?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, here’s what I need. I need someone to explain to me what the problem is. In simple terms. We don’t understand Clementine, she doesn’t understand us, that’s an easy problem to fix. Why are we having this meeting on the roof like it’s the war room? Why did you two bring us up here?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because of something Leif just showed me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me direct your attention to this display.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">“This display?” Isn’t that a 1989 Zenith?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m salvaging from multiple time periods, you take what you can get.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I watch “Who’s the Boss?” Later?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This oval is a cosmic microwave background. A remnant of the first light that could ever travel freely throughout a Universe. I did this scan from here, while we were dealing with the Mall Zombies.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shopzies.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not calling them that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the furthest that light had been able to travel, this is as far as any telescope can see. This is, in a very basic way, everything.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything in the universe is now contained on this 1989 Zenith?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s called a Sky Scan, the Planck does it all the time. Ava’s idea was to use the sky scan of every universe we go to as a sort of fingerprint. Theoretically every universe we go to would have a unique Cosmic Microwave Background. We use the sky scan as a fingerprint and keep them on file, so we could always know if we’ve been to a universe before.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a fantastic idea, Ava.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">She knows.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But Leif was also working on another project and not telling me, which he promises to never do again.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, it was a shot in the dark. I didn’t think anything would come of it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’d you find?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The first time we met Clementine, I accidentally grabbed her energy signature in the Sky Scan. So, on a whim, I decided to Scan the Universe for her energy signature. Check it out...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It’s everywhere.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s everywhere in the universe, how could she have been everywhere in the universe?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not all.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I also scanned the mall zombies back at the mall. They have the same trace energy signature as Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I kept talking about damage to the fabric of spacetime. Leif has found the energy signature that damage to the fabric of spacetime emits. The mall was covered with these energies AND so was Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t know yet. But looking at this sample universe, there is damage to space time fabric everywhere in the universe. This damage can only be caused by a gravity wave. For a gravity wave to cause this amount of damage... something very, very big had to happen. Something bigger than has ever even been theorized. Something massive occurred and the wreckage of it is everywhere.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are we just now seeing this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We just started looking. We may have been seeing it all along, we just didn’t know what to call it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Could it have been caused by her?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. She is pretty powerful.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not feeling right about it. She may have strange gifts but she’s just as lost as anyone we’ve known. She’s a piece to the puzzle, she ain’t the puzzle.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">All of this is interesting, but what do we do? I feel like we’re sitting here wondering about things but there’s nothing to do, I need to do things.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what’s going on yet. I need more data.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now that I’m set up up here, we’ll learn more with every place we visit.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, Leif, what is going on on the roof? It’s like Santa’s Workshop up here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pretty great, right? I’ve got like five projects up and running.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you fix the standing mixer yet?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got six projects up and running.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here comes the bass drop.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DINER SETS DOWN. WE HEAR PULSATING DANCE MUSIC AND PARTY GOERS, ALSO GLASS SMASHING AND CARS BURNING.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay, didn’t mean that literally.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is all this?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it a party or is it a riot?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it’s both? It’s like Mardi Gras with violence.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re in the UK somewhere. Look at the street signs.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that spray-painted on that building?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Welcome Ashley.”</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s Ashley?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Incoming.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Drunk.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello up there.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">What a delightful cafe, Is it new?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We just opened.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a diner.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? Like the Americans?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like Americans.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Neither do we.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do you put pumpkin spice in everything?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s Ashley?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah yes, Ashley! She’s a Death God. She drags souls into the underworld to torture them forever.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And she’s stopping by later?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you not heard of Ashley?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh dear, you’re not calling it something else in America, are you?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Calling what something else?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you have kebabs?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have to make do then.</p>
<p class="direction">JOSH WALKS INSIDE.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guess we have a customer.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Effie, vibe check?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I... Well Gloria it’s just the strangest thing. One minute I feel tranquility, the other panic and fear. It’s very confusing in this place.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s go talk to this guy.</p>
<p class="direction">LATER. JOSH EATS TACOS AND WON’T SHUT UP.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is brilliant. This is brilliant. This is what they’re meant to taste like? Tacos? No surprise that they don’t have them like this here. Most places here have a neon sign that involves a sombrero, which I feel is not the most culturally accurate design aesthetic for the taco. Who invented them? Was it the Spaniards?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">18th century silver miners.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shut up, it was the Aztecs.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really, the Aztecs? All those millennia ago they were eating things like this?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Theirs were full of fish and organs but sure.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Isn’t it funny how you don’t have to pass a test to call yourself a history buff?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Or a life coach, but who’s counting?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, saying they’re full of fish and organs does make them sound more British doesn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, Josh, what’s going on outside? It’s pretty crazy out there, did you win a football match or something?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">May I say, while the food is really divine, the atmosphere in this establishment is a bit off. You’re all just here, going about your daily lives while all this is going on?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">While all what is going on?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">The arrival of Ashley, of course.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who is Ashley?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this a cult thing? Are they going to put us in a wicker man?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t tell if you’re being serious or not.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We get that a lot.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do us a favor. Treat us like we’ve been trapped in a mine for two years. What do we need to know?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah. What a fascinating game. Very well. First off, I am deeply sorry for the mining disaster you have just endured, mining accidents are far more prevalent that one expects. Secondly, while you were trapped in the aforementioned mine, the world discovered Ashley. Ashley is an asteroid. She is headed for Earth. She is 9.3 kilometers wide and she is headed for Earth. We are all doomed.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, God.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve known for a few months now. Everyone took the time to sit down with their families and have a talk about being doomed and saying their last goodbyes. Then after all that we found we had many more months until Ashley arrived and wiped us out so I suppose we should get pissed and set a few things aflame. With 14 months to go we may run out of things to set fire to, so we may have to find some other irresponsible act to indulge in. Perhaps blowing things up?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That explains the crowd’s behavior. They’ve managed to set fire to a Verizon kiosk now.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah! They finally got it lit, good on them.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">14 months?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s pretty far out to detect an asteroid, how’d they catch it?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wasn’t them, it was me. I shouldn’t say me. It was us. Myself and my wife.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re the ones who found it?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re astrophysicists, my wife and myself. We work at the observatory. Now the most famous observatory in the world. Just up the hill there.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you said it was 9 kilometers wide?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Quite a large woman, Ashley. Roughly the size of the fabled dinosaur slayer. We will literally go the way of the dinosaur in a little over a year. I’ve been wondering if our early warning was a blessing or a curse. Perhaps just a week would’ve been better. People have been coming up with far too complicated bucket lists now that doom approaches AND they have the time.</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a man in Surrey who is making a bobsled entirely out of butter and plans to slide all the way down Box Hill with it. Not the usual end times behaviors one would expect.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is now someone trying to leap over the flaming Verizon kiosk.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Behaviors such as that, exactly, leaping over flaming objects.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And now he’s on fire.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, are we in Greenwich?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You work at the Big Onion?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big onion?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We do.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Royal Observatory isn’t powerful enough to pick up something that far out. 14 months?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apologies, have I stumbled into a cafe full of astrophysicists?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kind of.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, to answer your question, that is correct. The Royal Observatory didn’t find our future executioner. Our algorithm did. We wanted a better way of finding objects hurtling toward us so we created an algorithm that cross-referenced all the public data from every observatory in the world. We were very proud of ourselves. We saw ourselves creating a patchwork of data across the heavens. As it turns out, all we were doing was drawing a giant pentagram on the floor and conjuring a demon named Ashley that was now going to destroy the world.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">14 months, it hasn’t passed Jupiter yet, I’m guessing. Are you sure Jupiter isn’t going to grab it? In fact, there’s a a lot of celestial bodies for it to pass by before it would get here. What about the asteroid belt?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We had hoped for that, but I’m afraid the path is clear. None of our celestial big brothers are coming to our rescue. Ashley is headed straight for us, and there’s nothing to be done.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Staff meeting at the radio, please?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, yes, talk that over. Must’ve been an awfully deep mine you were trapped in.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, let me start this meeting by saying I am always pretty impressed by what we’re able to pull off in the course of one shift.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">However.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big rock.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">BIG rock.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not small.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m still a little iffy on my metric system conversions y’all, how big is this rock exactly?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Imagine the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now imagine thirty of them.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Falling down on their heads?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I get the Readers Digest version of what’s going to happen exactly?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, let’s see. 9.3 kilometers. Impact crater alone will be about-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">150, 160.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Miles wide.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Earthquakes around the planet registering 11 on the richter scale.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that’ll depend on how directly it hits.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Organic matter within a thousand miles of impact will be disintegrated.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Landing in the ocean will cut you a little slack.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then everyone gets 300 foot tsunamis.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Impact wave, then fireball, then-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">-Volcanic rock will launch into space then come back down all over the world.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then after all that will be creeping doom.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ash cloud covers everything for three years. Freezing temperatures. Then after that, very high temperatures for a generation at least.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yes, that is the Reader’s Digest version.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re fucked.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not all of them.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’ll be some lucky ones.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Lucky” is not the word I would look for.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They will have to live in a total hellscape for a very long time.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I understand why everyone’s drunk now.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are we supposed to do in this situation?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t sound like there’s anything we can do. Damn.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, if I may. Tragedy is coming to this planet quite soon. It weighs heavy. And there are all sorts of readings from Noah that I could engage in but perhaps I’ll just say this: What has God given them? What can be used?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Time.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Indeed. They have been given a warning, as did Noah. What can they do with this time and what can we do to help them with it?</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pardon me, I’m looking for a sloshed astrophysicist.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Darling! There you are! I’m eating tacos!</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll alert the media, Dear.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone! This is my wife Mallory Mae the most brilliant astrophysicist in the realm.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello all, I hope he hasn’t been too much of a burden.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s fine. I mean, considering everything that’s going on, it’s not surprising.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Josh, can we move along please? I’ve brought the car and I’d like to leave before it’s turned into a burning effigy by you and your friends.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mal, it’s the strangest thing. No one who works here had heard anything about Ashley.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perhaps they’ve heard nothing about Ashley because there’s nothing to hear about Ashley.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>

<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, all. You’re obviously on my side of this or you wouldn’t be here. No one opens a restaurant when they think they’re going to be obliterated in 14 months.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your side of this?</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, you’re saying that an asteroid isn’t on a collision course with Earth?</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">It isn’t.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you stop with this?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve seen it, Mal. Billions of people have seen it.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">And billions of people haven’t. Don’t you think I would need to see it for it to be real?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know why you can’t see it I just know that I can.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on. Is there an asteroid headed for Earth or not?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. One of you start from the beginning.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you really not heard anything about this?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been on a camping trip.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">For eight months?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We got lost.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your husband told us that you two created an algorithm.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, well, that’s where it started. We created a system where the data from every array on the planet coalesced into one data pool and from that pool we would be better able to identify NEOs. When we first got it up and running, he woke me up one night. “Darling, I’ve got one! I’ve named it Ashley!” Then it all went downhill from there.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">She couldn’t see it. I showed her an ocean of data and it was like it wasn’t even there. I thought I was losing my mind.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought I was losing my mind.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We didn’t know what to do so I sent the data to... who did I send the data to first darling?</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Curtis Charles, Sr. at SALT.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, yes, and Curtis said the same thing. Couldn’t see anything in the data. But then I sent another package to Paul A. Johnson at the GMT. He could see it.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that began a rabid debate between every observatory in the world.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Half of us could see it, half of us couldn’t.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were split down the middle.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird shit alert.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um hm.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">We had no idea what to do about it. So we all retreated to our respective corners, scratching our heads a bit. Come to find out all those who could see Ashley were meeting secretly online and sharing data. Data that we couldn’t see.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’d been arguing about it so much that we didn’t bother to calculate the trajectory. Once we did, well...</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">They went wider with their findings and it was the same reaction. Half could see it, half couldn’t.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It all went tits up from that moment.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Institutions, then politicians, then world leaders. Half can see Ashley. The other half, like me, can’t see her at all.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I may have cocked it all up a few weeks ago when I went online and told the people of the world that if you can see Ashley to come here to Greenwich so that all who see her can be together.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe not the greatest idea.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, it involved many more flaming automobiles than I had expected. In my defense I had just recently discovered alcohol.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">The whole world’s in chaos now. Half won’t come in to work and the other half don’t understand what on Earth they’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Psst.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, hang on just one second, okay?... What is it Effie?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the feeling I was speaking on before. Half doom and destruction and the other half confusion. Nothing but crossed wires.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How can one half of the whole planet see it but not the other?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you think this is what we were just talking about? More gravity wave damage?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, who’s right? Are they all about to be obliterated or not?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe, but I need to see more. I need to get to their observatory.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I should probably come.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, Leif you stay here. Whatever you’ve got going on on the roof may be more advanced than what they have. We may need it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good point.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you think they have a system you can hack into or something?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">For sure.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, Ava and I will go to the observatory, Leif go up to the roof, Caspar’ll stay here and watch the diner.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m fine by myself.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m coming with you</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come on, you’ll go to the observatory and look at an asteroid, it’ll be like a Kate Bush video.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please, no.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, stargazers. We need to take a trip up to your observatory.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need to see your data.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need to see if you’ve made any mistakes.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I beg your pardon again.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here’s the thing. Ava here is a theoretical physicist who thinks that your problem may not be of the astrophysical variety, it may be more of a... something else problem. We would love to take a look at whatever data you have.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve just met you, why would we let you into our observatory?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I’m smarter than you-</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">-Because... because let’s face it. You have no solutions and you have drifted into “crazy idea territory”. Crazy ideas like “let’s let some strangers into the observatory”.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it sounds lovely darling, I think you should do it.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’re the best judge of things, are you?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not at all but you know... stopped clock, twice a day, all that.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Fuck it, let’s go.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good luck!</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re coming, too, Dudley Moore, pick yourself up.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no, darling I can’t. I’ve got a very busy pre-doomsday schedule. Many things I’m excited about.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You are not going on a fox hunt.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>

<p class="character">NEWSCASTER</p>
<p class="dialogue">...The world continues to reel in what is now being referred to as “The Ashley Effect”. Small communities have begun to appear all over the globe made up of those who believe that the world is coming to an end.

<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s interesting isn’t it? When faced with encroaching doom, people get in touch with their deepest desires. Those things they suppress. Did they all decide to finally tell the people they love how they truly feel? No. Turns out their deepest desire was to incinerate their neighbor’s Peugeot. Strange people, us.</p>

<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was late at night when I discovered Ashley. I wasn’t looking for a near earth object, I was actually looking for nothing. I was calibrating the system by first seeing what nothing looks like. So I observed an area of space where I knew there was nothing. Then, in that blank space in that sky, suddenly I saw Ashley.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s doing this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She made a world-killing asteroid that can only been seen by half of Earth, why would she do that?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, we’re saying this woman has some sort of magical powers?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She wouldn’t do it on purpose.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She did it without knowing she was doing it?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m very confused at this moment.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on... Hang on... Okay, for the first time in my life, I hope I’m wrong.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s wrong?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, you’ve been scanning every universe we go to, right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you done with this one?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s ready.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Put it up on one of the monitors here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sending it.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Every universe? What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I promise I’ll answer all your questions later, okay? Right now I just need you to go with me.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s exciting, dear, let’s go with her.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go on, then.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re both astrophysicists, you’ve probably looked at the cosmic microwave background a million times, right?</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what it looks like?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It used to be my screensaver.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s up.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Both of you, look at this. What do you see?</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the cosmic microwave background.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">No it isn’t.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not the cosmic microwave background, Dear. It’s A cosmic microwave background but it’s not ours. Look, there’s this bit here, that’s new. There’s a little part here that looks like Spongebob, hello Spongebob.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t see any of that, what are you looking at?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m looking at what you’re looking at.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">God, it’s happening again.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Holy shit.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going on, Ava?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I showed them both a map of their universe. They’re seeing two different universes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But they’re in the same place.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that possible?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not... I think Clementine... I can’t believe I’m saying this... I think Clementine has taken two universes and crammed them together.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Crammed them together?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s impossible.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She can’t do that.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re saying this strange woman we met has done this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s ludicrous.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I also think that’s ludicrous and I’m completely pissed.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">How... how would she even do that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. And I don’t think she knows either.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">This was an accident?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What logical reason would she have to do this?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, how can two universes exist in the same place?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They can’t! This is what I’m trying to tell you. She’s breaking things. She’s... unraveling everything.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re sure it’s not on purpose?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I may just chime in while we are dangling out here in the beyond?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it Effie?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s that voice again, there’s mystery voices coming from somewhere, Darling.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">At what point should I stop asking questions and just let this complete nonsense wash over me?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right about now.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, this woman was afraid and angry but she had plans she was working on. This doesn’t appear to be part of any plan.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, and though she appears to be more powerful than anything we’ve encountered, everything in her comportment showed her to be human. Like us.</p>
<p class="dialogue">If any of us were given this power, would we be so adept at using it? Would we not make mistakes?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re talking about a lot here, we need to stick a pin in most of it and focus on the problem.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big rock.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">BIG rock.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not small.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Might we add “getting Effie and Zebulon out of this contraption” to this list?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, that too.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry all but... are you saying there’s nothing wrong with me? Nothing wrong with half of the planet?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, there isn’t. Everyone on Earth has been put in a LITERALLY impossible position. In 14 months an asteroid is going to hit the planet and cause massive destruction. But it will only happen to half of you.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know it doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">So Mallory and myself could be standing at ground zero for this asteroid strike and I will be completely disintegrated while she just stands there wondering where I went?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are we meant to function in a world like that?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m back. The party has dispersed downstairs. Someone brought in a live sheep and threw the whole vibe off. Apparently there are some things that are even too weird for the apocalypse. In a nutshell: experiment failed. What are we talking about?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Turns out there is and isn’t an asteroid.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s looking like Clementine has somehow crashed two realities together. For half the planet the asteroid is coming, for the other half it isn’t coming.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So both things are happening-slash-not happening?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I bet Ava loves this.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shut up.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what are we doing now? Can we do anything?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on, I’ve got data coming in... Okay. Nice work, Mucklewains.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re just sitting here, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got eyes on Ashley and you’re not going to believe this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Send it here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Check it out...</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not one asteroid it’s two smaller asteroids. They’re rotating around each other in such close proximity that they look like one asteroid from far away.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Darling, it’s twins!</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, that’s interesting but isn’t that the same amount of destruction as one big one?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh. Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great work, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But... BUT now we have something to work with, don’t we asteroid experts?</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Centrifugal force?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right. The Mucklewains have given me control of the Juno probe. And guess what Juno has?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">A thruster?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Juno has to dip in and out of Jupiter’s obit to avoid getting singed by radiation, so it has a heavy thruster on it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on. Are we ramming the Mucklewains into an asteroid, because that would be funny.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what I’m thinking.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, not in one million of the Lord’s years are you going to treat us like some sort of celestial cue ball to be hit with your stick!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’ll be fine.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">I say it’s a fine idea, but calculations such as those would take years.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want to ram an asteroid with the Mucklewains?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">To say I have objections would be perhaps understating it a bit.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, look, if we did this we can cut the destruction in half. It would still be an epic disaster, but if I can push one of these asteroids out of the way, that may contain the damage to one quarter of the globe.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Destroying one quarter of the globe is good news?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">In this scenario? Yes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are to be turned into some sort of battering ram?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going to happen to Effie and Zebulon?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">My guess is they’ll be fine.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, your guess? You’re just going to embrace wild speculation when it comes to our well-being?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, you got yourselves out there, I’m sure you can get yourselves back.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t talk to me like you know what you’re talking about, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m working with what I’ve got here.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, I believe what Leif is trying to tell us, is that if we do this, lives will be saved. Is that right, Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The damage can be cut in half if we give one of these asteroids a shove at the right time.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aw, snails!... Alright, Leif. Load us into your cannon and fire us across the circus tent.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Starting calculations.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this really going to work, Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Slamming a probe into a space rock? That’s where I live.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The best part about this, is that Josh and Mallory are across the room right now and have no idea what the hell is going on.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true I have no idea what on Earth is happening but I am suddenly feeling strangely hopeful.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just feeling strange.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, Leif, assuming this works, what kind of destruction are we looking at now?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I pull this off we go from world-killing asteroid to really terrible global crisis asteroid.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t sound much better.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, trust me, it is. Planets can take a pretty big punch without losing atmosphere. If they can manage to evacuate the area of the globe the asteroid’s going to hit, they might come out okay for the most part. It’ll be several years of tough times, but they can get through it.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, that’s the next thing, we need to know where it’s going to hit.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Those kind of calculations are nearly impossible-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Got it right here.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who is this man?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Western Australia.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lord... There goes that trip to the outback we were going to take.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">As asteroid strikes go, it could be worse. I was hoping for the south Atlantic but, Western Australia’s got a lot of open space. Not much population to evacuate.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">But the aftermath.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. I’m guessing three years of winter for the whole planet and a whole lot of environmental repercussions.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But only for half of the planet?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. In this strange new world that Clementine has created, this is only going to happen for half the population.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that even going to look like?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No idea.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got some ideas. Leif should get going with the Mucklewains, we’ll do the other stuff.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Effie, Zebulon, we love you very much. Please remember that as Leif launches you head first into a real big rock.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel at times that our Christian inclination for forgiveness is being taken advantage of.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It definitely is. Good luck.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to sign off. I’ll let you know when we’re ready to launch.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE BACK TO THE ROOF OF THE DINER.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, team. Let play asteroid snooker.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I know your intentions are good but I must tell you that I have never wanted to whup someone so badly as I do now.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I validate your feelings.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Petition to start calling them The Misslewains?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Petition denied.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on tight, you two. I’m going to have to adjust your position a little bit. You’re going to be turning away from Jupiter and into deep space. Are you ready?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course we’re not ready.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="dialogue">Why is that important?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because your world can’t exist like this. Eventually the universe is going to try to right itself, and what will help that is communication. Contact between two worlds. If you keep that up, I think eventually you can be living in the same world again.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I’ve never been a fan of marriage. For me it’s like: marriage is great. But for you. You go do it and I’ll be over here. I like that it’s around but it’s not for me. Like skydiving. That looks like fun, for you. I will watch the video of you doing it and feel just fine about not doing it. But, my old sous chef Cesar is married and has a ton of kids. Him and his wife fight all the time about everything. But it’s part of their relationship, like I don’t know what they would do if they weren’t fighting. And sometimes when they’re on the opposite ends of an argument I wonder if they even live in the same world. I don’t know, I don’t think we’re ever in the same world as someone else, no matter how close you are. There’s always this big space between you. You can’t be inside someone else’s head, so you need to tell people what’s going on in your world.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Josh is about to go through a lot. His world is going to get very dark and there’s not going to be anything you can do about it, except listen to him.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">After this thing hits, the sun’s not coming out for three years, Josh. For years half the people on this planet will be struggling to survive while the other half looks at them like they’re crazy. I wish I could describe it better than that but I honestly have no idea what it’s going to look like. We’re in uncharted territory.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you’re going to have to keep talking to each other. You’re going to have to try and understand each other even though you can’t understand each other, understand?</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so.</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">What should we do now?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re going to need to get the word out. You work here so people will listen to you. You need to warn everyone that what’s left of Ashley is coming down in Western Australia.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif is leaving you with all of the information you need to prove it. Just get it all out there and warn people. Things’ll start moving pretty quickly after that.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But before that... Come on back to the diner. We’re going to launch a couple of our friends at an asteroid.</p>

<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course I will.</p>
<p class="character">MALLORY</p>
<p class="dialogue">... And do you think it’s possible that we’ve actually hallucinated this entire encounter with an American cafe that happened to house a physicist who’d been missing for years and her strange friends?</p>
<p class="character">JOSH</p>
<p class="dialogue">It certainly sounds like a hallucination. But I have enjoyed hallucinating it together.</p>

<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Folks, it’s a beautiful day here at Cape Canaveral where everyone is waiting with anticipation for us to launch these two old-timey Baptists into a space rock the size Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

<p class="dialogue">For what it’s worth, my scientific opinion is that you’re both going to be fine.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You definitely did but, what exactly is happening?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
