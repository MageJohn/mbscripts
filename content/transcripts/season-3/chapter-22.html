<p class="direction">THE SOUND OF SPACE TIME SPINNING PAST US AS A SONG PLAYS ON THE RADIO. DISTANT SOUND OF PENCIL SCRATCHING ON PAPER.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, you mean to tell me that there is a television show that portrays stories from the bible...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Issac, Abraham, even Jesus.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But all of the biblical characters are portrayed by what now?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Vegetables.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...How..</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why...</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is there...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can see you trying to make sense of it, and I wish you luck.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Coffee’s ready.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Excellent.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still nothing?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s been like that for hours, she’s almost burned through a whole notebook.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I admire her dedication but does she need a glass of water or some such?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have begun to worry that her pencil may ignite.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe I should bring her some food?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, she won’t even know you’re there.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if it’s really good food though?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">In any lab or testing field or observatory you’re going to see this. There’s people filing reports, compiling data, getting coffee, the janitor comes by, maybe a senator visits, and then off in a corner somewhere, surrounded by, what looks like, the notes of a serial killer... will be the theorist. Trapped in their head until they finally come up for air. Watch this. Hey, Ava?... Yeah, nothing.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we stand here until she decides to talk to us?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can stand anywhere we want, we’re not going to exist until she’s ready for us to exist.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We may have one thing working in our favor.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m having a cigarette.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There we go.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We should probably get our questions in fast, she’s going to suck that down like a shopvac, let’s go Mucklewains.</p>
<p class="direction">DOOR CHIME. THE SOUND OF SPACE TIME GROWS LOUDER.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, do you need anything? You’re looking a little pale.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re probably going to touch down soon, anything we need to know?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I am now ready to talk about the disappearing lady.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s do it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you need coffee?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her energy signature when she disappeared, that was different than when The Ex would pop into our lives, right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">For sure.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also her voice was different. She sounded human.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we’re probably not dealing with Caspar’s alternate reality Ex-wife throwing ANOTHER bot at us. This isn’t a Terminator 2 situation?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, also she didn’t smell like anything. Ex had a particular scent when she would teleport.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tachyons smell like popcorn.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Good.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop smelling the androids.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not being weird.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just want to make sure we’ve all registered that this is not, in any way, my fault.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a refreshing change of pace isn’t it, Dear?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What will I do with myself?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was disguised as the Ambassador from Luxembourg?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But what were you saying about her name?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">She picked the name of an actual person but from the 15th century, she probably thought no one would notice.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But she spoke in a fake accent, was putting on a whole show.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s been doing this for a while.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doing what for a while though?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Traveling. And we’ve been on her trail, trying to get her attention. She’s the thing we’ve been trying to track down.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure seems like it.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why Earth?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is she sticking to Earth? Let’s assume she can shift through time and fold space. Why would she stick to Earth?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’s nearby?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wouldn’t matter. If she can fold space without any tech then distance becomes irrelevant, traveling to St. Petersberg is the same as traveling to the other side of the universe.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">So she’s on Earth on purpose.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so. “Are you trying to stop me?” That’s what she said. Stop what?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s definitely got an agenda. And she was not happy to see us.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I was not happy to see her. I have dark perturbations about this woman.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why though?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a thicket of feelings I get from her. It’s one thing but also another.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perhaps if we wish to know the nature of this new character in our lives we should look to ourselves.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are ordinary folks in an extraordinary life. Perhaps she’s not so different. And why have we found ourselves here? Either running or seeking, all of us. Perhaps it is the same for her.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s where my feelings point me. But it’s both of those things. Seeking and running. And those two mixed together in the wrong way can be...</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dangerous.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re talking about a lot without actually saying anything. We think she’s a problem, we don’t know why. She’s thinks we’re a problem and doesn’t know why. Right now all we know is, there’s a disappearing lady that doesn’t like us.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s not to like?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, we’re delightful except for Leif who kills people randomly.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not true.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, you didn’t kill a guy?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wasn’t random.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long until we land?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any second now.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, just keep your eyes open, okay? That wasn’t the last time we’re going to see her. Also, there’s something that I want us to start looking for.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not getting a cat.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why can’t we get a cat?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t just say we’re not getting a cat.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where did discussion of a cat come from all of a sudden?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">If we get a cat it’s going to hate me.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we all benefit from that.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think a cat may be nice.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Sorry.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Damage to the fabric of space time. I want us to keep a look out for damage to the fabric of space time.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s it look like?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No idea.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here we go.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DINER SNAPS INTO A NEW REALITY. WE HEAR MUSAK.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we...</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this what I think it is?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we in a mall?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That music is terrible.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well this is an unsavory establishment.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this some sort of warehouse?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh it’s a warehouse alright. For commerce.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that smell?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That, Effie, is the food court.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They have put food there to be judged somehow?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, that’s just where all the food places are.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have judged it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I’t not a great smell.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, shit, check it out: B. Dalton.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, we’re in an OLD mall.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">1980’s for sure.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The golden age.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s probably a Camelot Music here.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s probably a Chess King.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hickory Farms, anyone?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Free cheese samples!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s probably a Jazzercise!</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ava, what in the world are they talking about?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, I actually did something with my life.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where is everyone, though?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess they haven’t opened yet, all the gates are down.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well at least there’ll be one good spot in the food court today.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re really going to give Mrs. Fields’ Cookies a run for it’s money.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we spread out and look for things?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Damage to the fabric of space time?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I know it’s vague but it’s important. Damage to the fabric of space time.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Should be easy to spot. Pardon me, sir, is that damage to the fabric of space time you’ve got there?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We should head over to Spencer’s Gifts that place is definitely a disturbance in the fabric of space time.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Split up for a little while, everyone. You guys take the bottom floor, Ava let’s go upstairs.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s taking the Mucklewains?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Suddenly in the loud speaker system for the Mall.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we’ll be just- oh my!</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the loud speaker system as well.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goodness. We appear to be in the Public Address system for this establishment.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can y’all hear us?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cool.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel very large.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I feel as though my spirit wraps around this whole construction.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess you’re going with all of us then.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anything we can grab you while we’re looking?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">From a 1980s mall? All of this stuff’s garbage.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How about a sharper image foot massager?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Okay, yeah, get me the foot massager.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anything else?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do they have pencils here?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Pencils?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">At the mall?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They don’t have useful things here, just the things you can’t live without.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Never mind.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good luck on your space/time anomaly hunt!... We’re going to hit the Orange Julius before we start looking around right?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely.</p>
<p class="direction">GLORIA AND AVA RIDE AN ESCALATOR.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, damage to the fabric of space time?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It can look like anything. Also nothing.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. On it. Why are we doing this?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... Okay, I’m working with four separate things right now.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good. Bullet points are good.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thing 1: Imagine a string of pearls, but not in a loop. Imagine a string of pearls continuing out into infinity.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, infinite pearls.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Imagine each pearl as a universe. All matter and energy that exists is in each pearl.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a lot of universes.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Every day when we open our doors, we’re in one of those pearls. A new universe. One of these infinite pearls is where we started, and we are constantly zipping back and forth through different pearls. Each one of them have a beginning, middle and end that runs for billions of years.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds way more organized than what we actually do.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re not actually in a string they’re actually all overlapping each other and occurring simultaneously but it’s better to imagine them on a string.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Agreed.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thing 2: Chuck said something about massive gravity waves. Inside each pearl are massive destructive events that happen. Sometimes they’re so powerful that they can damage the pearl they take place in. The effects can be cataclysmic.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this like a supernova, a whole star exploding?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it goes beyond that. When something is so powerful that it can damage the fabric of space-time... Imagine a house on a beach, and a tidal wave is coming toward it. Imagine this wave being so powerful that it doesn’t just damage the house, it... damages the very idea of what a house is.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The idea of what a house is?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">A gravity wave can be so powerful that it can damage not just matter, but damage how matter works.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t like that.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t either.</p>
<p class="character">AVA (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The third thing is us. A time-traveling dimension-spanning diner. And the fourth thing:</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The disappearing lady.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did Chuck describer her? “Powerful? Formidable?”</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It looks like she’s able to travel through space and time like we do but she can do it at will, so yeah that’s pretty powerful and formidable.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">... She’s scared.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can see it. She was scared of us for some reason.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t imagine why that would be.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Laughing.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wicks and Sticks. Did you ever go here?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wasn’t a mall person.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I used to look at this place and be like “That’s what a real woman does, she has all kinds of nice candles everywhere. That’s when I’ll know I’ve become a real woman.”</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you ever get your candles?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Because then it became “having a nice kitchen” meant I was a real person, and then it became “having a really nice couch” for some reason, not sure what that was about. Then it became a restaurant.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it now?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ, I have no fucking clue. Self-completion is a moving target. I mean, look at me. Look at us, look at what we do. We’re in a mall in the 80s looking for damage to the fabric of space time and I don’t feel much different than my teenage self. I thought candles were going to do it? Seriously?</p>

<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. People went crazy. They waited by the doors for the mall to open, not even in a line, just a mob of people. I was the first one here that day. It was way too early for anyone to go shopping, but there they were, all at the door to try and grab one of these Cabbage Patch Kids. When I unlocked the doors they pushed them open so hard that it knocked me down. They were running, like olympic style running to the KayBee Toys just to stand in line and wait for THEM to open. Eventually there was a line outside of every store that might possibly have one of these damn dolls. Montgomery Ward, Sears, whatever. There was even a line outside of Florsheim Shoes for some reason. Then they got the bad news. Delivery trucks ran late the day before and the dolls weren’t on the shelves, they were still in the trucks... They all start to panic. Like, sheer panic, like they’re life depended on it.</p>
<p class="dialogue">None of the stores had stocked any of the dolls yet so they rushed back into the loading zone and literally ransacked three trucks full of them. Dolls, y’all. People got into fist fights, one guy had a bat. It was chaos. I need backup so I call the police and they literally laughed at me, started calling me Santa’s little helper. So I say to myself “Please don’t let me die over some fucking dolls,” and I jump in there, trying to break it up... and then suddenly everybody was gone.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It looks grey.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s an industrial diamond, you can’t make it into jewelry. Still valuable though. Something this size, you’re looking at about a hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good call not putting it in the lost and found.</p>

<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, you’re talking about Mercury the planet?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was just going for a stroll on Mercury and picked up a diamond?</p>

<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is going on?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay look, let’s think about the thing right in front of us.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The thing right in front of us is a huge diamond from Mercury.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, the thing right in front of us is Tamara. She’s trapped in a time loop with mall zombies.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We could try and sneak her past the military blockade. Maybe if she could get away from the mall things would reset.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">My guess is you’d have entanglement problems. Her geographic location isn’t going to matter much.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Um. No, not really but that’s kind of your thing. You’re... y’know... unflappable.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did everybody else change?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, yeah. I mean, Caspar had to confront why he was such a tool all the time, Leif had to confront the fact that he was acting like three different guys, I took over the diner and went up against the Teds and really tapped into some anger.</p>

<p class="dialogue">How?</p>

<p class="character">TAMARA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So can you tell me what happens in the future, or not?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t work that way. I can tell you what MIGHT happen, but so can anybody else. For example, what might happen is that a couple of years from now two movies are going to come out: “Terminator” and “Back to the Future”.

<p class="dialogue">Today I officially transitioned into emeritus status, the flaming viking boat of academia. I did so under viscous rumors that I have lost my mind, which I shall wear as a badge of honor. I am proud to join the ranks of other nutty professors like Paracelsus, who believed in giants, Tycho Brahe who wore a copper prosthetic nose after losing his real one in a fist fight, and Pythagoras who had an inexplicable fear of beans.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You only get one chance to make a parting statement, so here goes. As we struggle to understand the universe, we may need to consider the idea that the universe is struggling to understand us. That our curiosity about the cosmos, may be reciprocated. Do our telescopes pointed skyward pose a question, and are the ebbs and flows of the starways an attempt at an answer. Are the scientist and their subject like two lovers in the dark; stumbling towards each other, hoping to find some skin... well, that got a little sexy didn’t it?</p>
