<p class="direction">FROM A BALCONY WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A BUSTLING MARKETPLACE AND THE MUSLIM CALL TO PRAYER. WE ARE IN JERUSALEM. THE YEAR IS 1399. SOMEONE PLAYS A LUTE FROM THE BALCONY.</p>
<p class="direction">SONG: STELLA SPLENDENS.</p>
<p class="direction">THE SONG IS INTERRUPTED BY A METEOR STREAKING THROUGH THE SKY. WE HEAR A DISTANT EXPLOSION BEHIND THE NEARBY MOUNTAINS.</p>
<p class="direction">THE SONG CONTINUES PLAYING AS WE MOVE TO THE NEXT MORNING. A LARGE IRON KNOCKER HITS A LARGE WOODEN DOOR. AFTER A MOMENT WE HEAR THE KNOCKING AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From behind the door.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric! Terric, open up, my friend.</p>
<p class="direction">THE LARGE DOOR OPENS.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do not believe we had business today, Yosef.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We do not, we do not. May I come in?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How have you been?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did I not see you yesterday, Yosef?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, of course. My mistake.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">To what do I owe this pleasure?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Many an interesting tale here in Yerushalem.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">True, it is a very interesting place.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Barquq has died.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have heard this.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have heard this?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I heard this in the market just this morning.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do not like it when you get the news not from me.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I apologize.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zuzanna is very worried about this.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">As I recall your wife is, at all times, worried about all things.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">With Barquq dead, his son inherits the kingdom. His son is only aged eleven years. Now I am hearing rumors of the Ottomans coming in from the East.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Ottomans will stay where they are.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You think?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">To take this city you must be up for a climb, and the Mamluks are already here so why bother?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well, very well.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this why you’ve come today? To warn me of the Ottomans?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I require your assistance.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting, that’s usually the other way round.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... strange things happening outside the city today.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was born in this city. Have lived in this city for all of my life. Somewhere along the way I have become a person that people come to when there are strange goings on.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">This I know.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two shepherds outside the city, they have come upon something strange and ask for my assistance.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">And?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I cannot give them my assistance.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is a woman.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">A woman.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They have found a woman outside the city.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Found? Explain what you mean by found.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is... I find this hard to explain, perhaps we should depart. See for ourselves.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is she lost?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is most definitely lost.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is most likely a pilgrim. Strayed from her congregation and found herself outside the city. How do you need my assistance?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... She is a woman alone.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">As you’ve said.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am... a married man. The shepherds are married men. We are pious men. Men of God.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You must be joking.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am not.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have come to me on this day because there is a single woman in the countryside.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you, as a pious, married, man, cannot be alone with a woman.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whereas I, an unmarried man and a Christian, can be alone with a woman without receiving God’s displeasure.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine you will still receive his displeasure, but you don’t seem to mind too much.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you expect me to do about a mysterious single woman in the countryside?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It will take us quite some time to get there, we shall discover a solution along the way.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">A solution. Yosef I have yet to see what the problem is. There is a woman outside the city, what is the crisis?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is... She is unusual.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">In what sense?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Her hair is the color of flames.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not unusual. At least not in my part of the world.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but in the countryside around the city, they grow worried of her presence. There is talk of witchcraft.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is always talk of witchcraft in the countryside, in fact that is all there is talk of in the countryside.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What of the... do not you English have something? What is it? Chivalry?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not a knight, I’m a scholar.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric. It is a woman alone. Let us be men.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Unfortunately my curiosity has been awakened.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">As I knew it would be.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well, Yosef. Let us go see a strange woman in the countryside.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE OUTSIDE OF THE CITY. THERE IS NOW A SMALL CROWD OF PEOPLE SPEAKING ARABIC.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well. There she is.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was found in this field by the shepherds. She has been lying there with her face to the ground throughout the day.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the reddest hair I’ve ever seen. You haven’t seen her face?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She will not raise her eyes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you’ve all just stood here?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The situation is more complex than you know, but perhaps you should first try and speak with her.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">The fact that you think your God would look unfavorably on you for giving assistance to a woman who is obviously in need of it is simply ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but I know I have my friend Terric, so I can remain pious and also help her through you.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Throughout the day she has been here, Yosef.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And her suffering soon shall end because you have arrived.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Give me that skin of water.</p>
<p class="direction">TERRIC SLOWLY APPROACHES, MOVING THROUGH THE GRASS IN THE FIELD.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">My lady.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are you?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am Terric of York. I have water.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not thirsty.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve been in the sun all day.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... May I see your face?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you been injured?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I... I can’t look up.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why can you not?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The... the sky. I can’t look at the sky.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You cannot look at the sky.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I look at the sky I get dizzy and fall down.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you ill?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="direction">YOSEF APPROACHES.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well met to you, my lady.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now you approach?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is not alone, now I approach.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">She won’t take water and is unable to rise.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She must though. There is an urgency to what we do.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I may not have been entirely honest back at your home.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They have come from surrounding farms to see this woman. They are very concerned she is a bad omen.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wonderful.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I may have assured them that you are going to take this woman and return with her to your homeland.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">My homeland.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of England.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is one problem with this endeavor, Yosef.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That you are not, in fact, returning to your homeland?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">All the same, I think we should make a show of it. We shall pretend you are taking her away, but we shall go around the mountain the long way and then take her into the city.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see that lies are completely accepted by your God.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I shall work such things out with Hashem. I have a covered wagon for us, we should leave. They are becoming very upset.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Bring the wagon round.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are a good man, Terric.</p>
<p class="direction">YOSEF RUNS OFF.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">My I ask your name?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go ahead.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What is your name?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t know your name?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t remember anything.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my. My lady, we must depart.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I will... take you back to my home in the city.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t even take two steps without falling.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I shall carry you.</p>
<p class="direction">LATER. TERRIC AND CLEMENTINE SIT IN THE BACK OF THE COVERED WAGON AS IT TRAVELS THE LONG WAY HOME.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does the covered wagon help?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You said you cannot look at the sky.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why is this?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have no idea.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have no memory of how you came to be lying in that field?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I tried walking for a long time, but every time I took a few steps I would fall.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is... strange.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you remember where you’re from? We speak the same tongue but your way of speaking is quite different from mine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t remember... Where am I?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, what’s Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jerusalem is... a city.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You shouldn’t worry. I’ve seen something like this before. My brother, Tybalt, has been in many battles, mostly skirmishes with Scotland. In the aftermath of one of these battles, he was horribly injured. He had a very difficult time remembering peoples names for days afterwards. You may have sustained an injury that has caused your memories to leave you, but they will return.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you tell me anything at all? Your last memory? Anything you can grasp in your mind?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It can’t be a memory, it has to be a dream.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I was surrounded by trees. They were so tall they seemed to reach for the sky. There were two people there looking down at me... I heard sirens approaching... Then I was lying down but going very fast. I could still hear the sirens... Then I was somewhere else, everyone was wearing blue... “We can’t”... what was it... “We can’t get the IV in her” they said that... Then they were gone... the room was empty and I ran... I flung the door open... I flung the door open and I was... I was suddenly floating above the Earth... I could see all of it... I could see the sunrise from above the Earth... then I started falling... my body was glowing red... then I woke up here...</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes, I would call that a dream.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Laughing)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... Can you tell me the date? Maybe that will help.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course. It is the 5th of June, in the year of our lord 1399.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the front of the wagon.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The year of his lord 1399. The year is 5159.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, shut it.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And who is that?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is Yosef. He is a friend.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you two don’t agree on what year it is?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">We agree that we are in the same year, we disagree on how to count the years.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Because I am a Christian and he is a Jew.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I fear your memories may be worse off than we thought.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A CELEBRATION IN THE STREETS.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Celebration of some sort. Yosef, who is that celebrating?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe the Armenians.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are they celebrating?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the city of Jerusalem, it is always someone’s religious holiday. You begin to ignore it.</p>
<p class="direction">THE WAGON PASSES BY THE CELEBRATION.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your name is Terric?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you for getting me out of that field, Terric.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you too, Yosef.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The pleasure is mine, My Lady.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...I don’t know what to do now.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No need to do anything. You will stay at my home until your mind returns to you. You will have everything you need.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if that takes a long time?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then take a long time, it shall.</p>
<p class="direction">THE WAGON ROLLS OFF INTO THE CITY AND WE FADE INTO SILENCE. THE SILENCE IS THEN BROKEN BY CLEMENTINE SUDDENLY WAKING UP. AS SOON AS SHE WAKES WE CAN HEAR TERRIC PLAYING “STELLA SPLENDENS” IN THE NEXT ROOM. SHE GETS OUT OF BED AND MOVES INTO THE MAIN ROOM. WHEN THE SONG ENDS SHE APPLAUDS.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">She finally awakens.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long was I out?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nearly an entire day.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I began to worry, but then I remembered that you survived an entire day in the Jerusalem sun without water. You’re made of sterner stuff.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you think they’re telling stories of a crazy red-headed woman to scare their children now?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Laughs.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">The way you speak is so strange.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The way you speak sounds pretty strange to me.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imagine so.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... Now what do I do?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve had quite some time to think on it. I cannot seem to find a path forward.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that the city out there?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Would you like to see?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t know. There’s a lot of sky out there.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">The city has been here for three thousand years, you have time to see it. Why do you believe looking at the sky makes you feel so ill at ease?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. It’s like... It’s like it’s something I’m not used to.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not used to? The sky is everywhere, you should probably begin to acquaint yourself.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Okay I’m going to walk up to the balcony, if I start to get weird don’t let me fall off.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I shall not.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE MOVES CLOSER TO THE BALCONY.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... This is okay... it’s beautiful.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">This time of day in particular, yes. We are in what’s becoming the “new city”. Over there, you can see the great walls. Behind those walls is the old city, the city that has been here since practically the dawn of man.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE MUSLIM CALL TO PRAYER ECHOING OUT OVER THE NEW CITY.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Muslim call to prayer. A man sings that at various times of day to let all those of Muslim faith know it is time to pray.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There’s so much I don’t understand.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It will come.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What were you playing just now?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Stella Splendens. It means Bright Star. I was actually conducting an experiment.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s the experiment?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">The other evening I played this song and a star fell from the sky as I played, I thought I would try it again but alas.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You thought playing a song would make a star fall from the sky?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perhaps it wasn’t the most scientific of experiments.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that thing?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I should be playing a lute but my lute was lost when I made the journey to Jerusalem. Then I was in an area of the new city where all of the Greeks congregate and there was a luthier. He had this for sale and I procured it. It is called a Bouzouki.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a funny name.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I should probably have a name.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure you have a name.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me too. But you have to call me something until I remember so... Call me something.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You want me to choose your name?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That would help, yes, if you would just... do it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Clementine.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Clementine?</p>

<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It means merciful.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Merciful?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Merciful.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. You like it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Then that’s me. Until I remember something, I’m Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well met, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to figure this out.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe you.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>

<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, how is our new friend enjoying the city?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s been several days now and she has yet to venture out into the city, but she appears to be doing well.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has she remembered anything?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s very strange.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, not even her name. She asked me to give her a name.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Give one to her?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I call her Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. After St. Clement. It means merciful.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It does not sound right coming out of my mouth, this is not a Jewish name.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course it’s not a Jewish name, Yosef. Did you expect me to give her a Jewish name?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If she had a Jewish name she may remember things.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">How in the world would a Jewish name help her remember who she was?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jews remember everything.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ridiculous.</p>

<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Beets.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is beets?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s... She asked for them, I thought I would try the marketplace.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never heard of them.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you never had a beet before?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You say this like it is impossible that I have not had a beet.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a root. It’s purple. They’re around every corner back home.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why has she asked for this?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am unsure.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perhaps this is progress?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is asking for beets progress?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She remembers that she wants something.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Suppose you’re right.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perhaps I should meet with her again.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">To be a friend, to be a neighbor, things such as this.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What are you up to?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am up to nothing.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can smell it on you when you have a scheme afoot, Yosef.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are no schemes on my feet, my friend.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>

<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There is only one thing in Jerusalem that outnumbers the holy men. What is this?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thieves.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thieves. Liars. What is that other word, the one I like?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Charlatans.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Charlatans. For some strange reason, houses of God attract both the pious and the profane. Who was our favorite, do you remember?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Salazar the Dough Mage.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is the one! He claimed his flatbread recipe was from the Virgin Mary. That it had been passed to him over the ages and that it offered absolution and healing to all who ate it. There are many like him all over this city.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are implying that she is one of these Charlatans.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I imply nothing. I simply say to you this: when you are around this woman do you feel that your head is clear?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you now in the marketplace trying to find her a root that does not exist?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What do you suggest?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The wine you have been asking for has finally arrived. I shall bring it by later this day. I shall stay, we shall talk, I shall make sure she is not selling magical flatbreads.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What will you be able to see that I could not?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Many, many things, my friend.</p>
<p class="direction">WE SHIFT BACK TO TERRIC’S HOUSE. TERRIC IS POURING WINE FOR EVERYONE.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, I’m sorry, you speak how many languages?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That may depend.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Depend on what?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">On what you need for me to say.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The language of the French, the Spanish, the language of Rome, I speak them very well. English, Arabic, very well. Greek, eh, I can give you directions.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you learn all these languages?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Around one hundred years ago, the Turks came. They swept through the city, leaving very few alive. Not just the Jews, Christians and Muslims as well. Any man or woman who lived in the New City or Old was marked for death. The hordes rode through the streets, killing everything in their path. For the longest time it was a city of ghosts. But then, far to the north in a city called Heidelburg a man, Isaac of Beilstein, decided it was time for the Jews to return to Yerushalem. My parents came with him. I was a young boy in Yerushalem trying to make my way. I was an errand boy for pilgrims from a place called Normandy. I learn French. You learn French, Spanish is not so difficult, you learn Spanish, the language of Rome is even easier. I even learned this bastard of a language, English.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">English is a beautiful language, one day the whole world will speak it.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Impossible.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">A man like Yosef is essential for life in Jerusalem. He speaks all of the languages, has relationships with all the right people, it would have been a very confusing city without him.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, why did you come here, Terric?</p>
<p class="direction">YOSEF LAUGHS TO HIMSELF.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cease your laughter.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I cannot help myself. I am so elated we have found ourselves here.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s so funny?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yosef thinks the focus of my scholarly activities is to be laughed at.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would you like some wine?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um. Sure. What is it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Try it.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE TRIES THE WINE.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kind of tastes like rotten fruit and wood.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is...</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is not far off from what it is supposed to taste like, yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do you drink this?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is a thing to be shared among friends.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s more widespread in my homeland. Mainly because the drinking water is quite often putrid.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What a paradise you describe.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, so, this is where Yosef was born. What about you, Terric? What is your home like, what is it called?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">York. It is a lovely place. Jewel of the Great North Road.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did you leave?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I left because it was home. And home can have its difficulties.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you came here?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. My studies brought me here.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your studies that Yosef likes to make fun of?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is so funny about what you’re studying?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is...</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Go on, do not be ashamed.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I study a much maligned science that concerns itself with many things. One of those things being the transmutation of lead into gold.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Why is that funny?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alchemy is a science that has been practiced for hundreds of years.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has it? And where is all this gold that has been made?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No one has yet achieved the transmutation of lead into gold.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, someone explain lead to me and someone explain gold to me.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, you truly have forgotten many things, haven’t you?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here...</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR A SMALL CHEST BEING OPENED AND LUMPS OF METAL BEING MOVED AROUND.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here is lead. Not without value. It has its uses. But it is drab. Gray. It is the color of an unending sadness.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I agree.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">And this... is gold.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oooh.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is an extraordinary metal. The rarest thing on this Earth. And I have dedicated my life to turning this lead... into this gold.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seems like that would be really hard to do.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">As I said, not one alchemist in all our history has found way to achieve this.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you keep at it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes we... keep at it.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... good luck.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We hope the answers will be revealed before your Messiah returns.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yosef, I think you’re being a little mean to Terric, this is obviously his life’s work.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have tried to tell him that I have already perfected the means to create gold.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? How do you do it?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is an ancient process, and shrouded in mystery. In the morning I rise. I move into the city and work all day long. By the end of the day I have magically created gold.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s merciless about this, he’s always been.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am fascinated by you Terric. You would spend ten years learning to make one lump of gold rather than working for ten years to make a pile of it.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am not trying to become a rich man.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You would learn how to create gold and not make yourself a wealthy man? This makes you an even greater fool.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve tried to explain this to you and it’s always fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are right. I shall cease. I must take my leave of you anyway. The Sisters of the Austrian Holy Cross need a guide into the old city. I must go and meet them. They pay very well, The Holy Sisters. Clementine. You may have lost all your memories but you have not lost your charisma.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks, Yosef.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know how to get word to me, should you need me?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I actually don’t have any idea how to do anything, Yosef, but I’m sure I can figure it out.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very good. Until the morrow, Terric!</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Until the morrow.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE DOOR CLOSE.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok. First of all. Wine is great. I don’t know whose idea it was but they did a great job, I’m a big fan.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m pleased that it pleases you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like you got your feelings hurt a little bit by Yosef just now.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yosef is a man one must grow accustomed to. He has lived a very different life from mine, so I must forgive his brutal frankness. I will say, in a city of so many different factions, and so much suspicion, he has proven himself a true friend.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... how do you do it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do what?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, you say that no one’s ever turned lead into gold but, how do you try to do it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Through experimentation in my laboratory.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your laboratory?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Through experimentation and notation in my laboratory.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I see it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">My laboratory?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t see why not. This way.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It seems quite chaotic but everything has it’s purpose. You can see boiling away here is the alembic. Here I have a mortar and pestle for pulverizing substances. The crucible here is to create an environment so hot that it can melt various metals. And built into the wall here is the athanor.</p>
<p class="direction">A SMALL IRON DOOR SWINGS OPEN FROM THE WALL.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes I have enjoyed your company.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well, how could you not enjoy a crazy person who doesn’t remember who she is living in your house?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I speak with you I find myself having to reconsider that which I had taken for granted.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I never know what anyone’s talking about?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Precisely.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re welcome.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I find myself now having to explain the importance of gold to you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t have to explain the importance of gold. I get it. It’s pretty, it’s rare, everyone wants it. I want to know why you do it. Why is it important to you? Why do all this? I know you’re not just trying to get rich.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am a nobleman. I am the second son of Tybalt the First, and back in my homeland we have a very nice castle and land as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’re here?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Because even as a young boy I knew I was going to leave.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I was a boy there was an uprising. The peasants of the land rose up in rebellion. They had been overtaxed and put upon for too many years, they made the brave choice to rise up against those who were oppressing them. My father was one of those oppressors and he, as well as other noblemen like him put down this rebellion. Violently. As a boy I watched from a window of the castle while the peasants were made an example of in the town square. Put into stocks. Sometimes executed.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I tried to see the difference between myself and these peasants. What is it that places them in the town square and I high above in a castle? I could only find one thing... I cannot describe to you how much this world revolves around that small lump of gold. It is the new axis on which the world turns. Men kill for it, die for it, go to war for it. And that boy high in that castle in York... he wanted it all to stop.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How would you do that?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">By flooding the world with it. What if I could make so much gold that no one ever wanted for anything? What if I could make the lords of the land irrelevant? What if the peasant had just as much gold as the king? What if we could be free of it all?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Are you trying to save the world, Terric?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s foolish, I know-</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not foolish. It’s beautiful... So why come here? Why not do all this at home?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jerusalem is one of the oldest cities in the world, as are its libraries. I sought ancient knowledge. There are few places more ancient than this place.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is there writing on the wall?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. The writing was here when I arrived, at first I thought to have it removed but I’ve grown to appreciate its presence.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>

<p class="dialogue">When I made the crossing from York to Jerusalem it took me many months.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Months?!</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two voyages over sea. Several horses. I was stranded in Greece for a month waiting for the weather to turn.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s more of a reason for them to be wondering about you.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your words are heard but, I am a second son.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am the son of Tybalt the First. My elder brother is Tybalt the Second. I am simply Terric. When you’re the second son of a lord you have one charge throughout your life: stay alive in the event that your brother dies. There must always be an heir.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds kind of horrible, Terric.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s for the best. I would make a terrible heir. I spend too much time in libraries. My father kept a massive library and was always puzzled when I would use the damn thing. He said being a scholar was akin to being gracefully impaired.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He sound like a great guy.</p>

<p class="dialogue">He is challenging.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you just... sit there?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I could have done. But instead I came here. Instead I chose this... rather odd life.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A life of laying in bed with forgetful women?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doesn’t sound so bad.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is, in fact, quite perfect.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I know you want to talk about the gold. I really don’t know what happened.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need not speak of it. Simply another mystery to unravel, there appears to be a thousand mysteries to unravel, no harm in adding one more. All gold is a mystery, really. It’s unlike any substance on Earth. I often wonder if it’s origins are different from the other rocks and metals of the Earth.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Perhaps if I could discern it’s origin, the key to transmutation would be revealed to me, but that is a mystery I’ve no idea how to unravel.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll let you know if I have any ideas.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you, my love.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So that’s all an alchemist does, huh? All gold all the time?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is one other goal of the alchemist, but it is an even more impossible goal than that of transmutation.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eternal life.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alchemists seek an elixir. The elixir of life. Something that will dispel all ailments and preserve youth. An alchemist is not simply seeking gold. An alchemist wishes to defeat death.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you really believe that?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m unsure. I know that I believe in knowledge. And I believe that, given enough time, all will be revealed. All aspects of life. The question that remains is, when? How long must we wait for the truth to be revealed?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Hey, speaking of the truth being revealed, I want to tell you something.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t want to remember who I am. I don’t want my memories back. I want to be Clementine. And I want to live in Jerusalem with Terric of York. I want that to be my life... do you want that to be your life?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I do.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Okay good. I... love you.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hmm. Not what I was expecting.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just, I want him to come home and I can say that I’ve been outside, and I saw some things and I got him something at the market. I... I want to show him that I’m here, that I’m here in Jerusalem with him.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Holy shit, this is so cold.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It awakens the senses, yes?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It feels like pure ice on my feet.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is important as a first stop, Clementine. You are in the bloodstream of Yerushalem, you will never be closer to her.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m glad—but how long to I have to stand in the cold water.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can be done. Let us warm up our feet with a walk along the wall.</p>
<p class="direction">LATER. CLEMENTINE AND YOSEF WALK ALONG THE WALL OF THE OLD CITY.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This wall is huge, who built this?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is a curious thing about Yerushalem. Everything you see belongs just a bit to everyone. The first people here were the Caananites. Then my people. After that the Assyrians, the Babylonians, and on and on. The city has changed hands many times. Everyone who has controlled it has broken down the wall, then built it back up again. Presently it is the Mamluks—they are not bad. They let people worship, they build. In a hundred years who knows who will control it. Whoever it may be, you hope they keep the city free for all peoples.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why do so many people want to control it?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is a question for another man. The life of the conqueror to me just seems like troubles. I prefer to talk to people, not to take things from them.</p>
<p class="direction">WE ARE IN THE MARKETPLACE AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">This marketplace has been here since I was a boy. I grew up in this place, running through the streets with my friends. You said you wished to get something for Terric at the market?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I don’t know what though.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sadly I cannot recommend the dates. They have gone wrong and I have not yet addressed this problem. Hashem willing, the crop will improve next season.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You keep saying that word.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which word?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hashem.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Indeed. Hashem. He is the father of us all.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is that like when other people say God?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is. But my word is Hashem.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you explain to me what all that means? God, Hashem, whatever. What is it?</p>
<p class="direction">YOSEF LAUGHS TO HIMSELF.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s so funny?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, look around you.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You stand in the City of God. For all of us, Christians, Muslims, Jews.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, you may be the only person to ever walk through the streets of Yerushalem to wonder what God is. Everyone here has already decided.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure I’ll get around to that eventually. In the meantime, can you tell me? What is Hashem? Can you describe it?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... In truth, I cannot.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought I was the only one.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can tell you of Hashem. But I cannot describe him.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why not?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I can see what Terric means now, about the way you speak. Look there, do you see those chickens?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you see the one with the limp?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That Chicken was made by Hashem.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also the man who sells the chickens. Also the ground the chickens roost upon, also everything in this marketplace, also the sky above that you fear so much. Hashem has made all of this. How could I possibly describe him?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He literally made everything?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because he loves us... Certainly from time to time he will become angry, he will lose his temper. He will bring a flood, bring plagues, turn people to salt.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Salt?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aside from those things, he loves us very much. Isn’t that nice?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, yeah I guess so... Lemons.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lemons?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I want to bring Terric some lemons.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why lemons?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. They’re colorful. Also they are clear proof that I went outside.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well. Lemons, you shall have.</p>
<p class="direction">LATER. YOSEF AND CLEMENTINE WALK DOWN A NARROW STREET.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are we taking this street?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t notice but there began to be several people looking at you in the marketplace. You were attracting attention.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, of course there is nothing wrong with attention but this kind of attention... I think it best we get back to your home before they begin to get more curious than they deserve to be.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have people really never seen red hair before?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is not just your hair, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have a way about you. You stand out in a crowd. It can make people nervous.</p>
<p class="direction">YOSEF STOPS WALKING.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Why are we stopping?</p>
<p class="direction">MEN MOVE INTO THE STREET IN FRONT OF AND BEHIND THEM.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Who are these men?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Grettings, my friends. Lovely day, is it not?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Why aren’t they answering you?</p>
<p class="direction">THE MEN APPROACH</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... They are thieves.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thieves?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We wish no trouble, my friends.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are they going to do?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We will hope that they only take our money.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What else would they do?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Remember to not look them in the eyes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh God.</p>
<p class="direction">THE MEN ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF THEM. CLEMENTINE’S VOICE SUDDENLY CHANGES.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Don’t touch me!</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE’S VOICE ECHOES ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS AS WE RETURN TO TERRIC’S HOUSE. THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have returned. You may be surprised to learn that I have not unraveled the great mysteries. I suppose I must return on the morrow.</p>

<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where is Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is in your special room.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>

<p class="dialogue">Terric.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Clementine asked me to take her into the city today.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? She’s never even left the house.</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">She wanted to show you that she could walk the streets like any other.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why didn’t you wait for me?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric, she did quite well. We had a lovely day in the city... But on the way back from the market. On the way back... there were thieves. We were attacked in the street.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did they do to her?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did they do to her? Clementine?!</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric... They did nothing to her. But you must speak with her.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What’s happened?</p>
<p class="character">YOSEF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric... I do not believe that Moses brought ten plagues to Egypt. I do not believe that Noah put all of the animals of the Earth into a boat. These are good stories. Stories for my children. But today... I do not know what I saw today... Speak with her. Know everything she tells you is true. I saw it happen... I must take my leave of you, my friend. I must go be with my family...</p>
