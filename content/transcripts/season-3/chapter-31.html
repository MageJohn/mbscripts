<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE FOREST. WE ARE BACK AT THE HORIZON MOTEL. CLEMENTINE APPEARS IN THE PARKING LOT.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank?</p>
<p class="direction">A CAR DRIVES INTO THE PARKING LOT AND PARKS. PETER AND STEPHANIE GET OUT OF THE CAR MID-ARGUMENT.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I will not, not in a million years, understand your obsession with starting over.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not obsessed, that’s completely unfair.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">No matter what we talk about, no matter what problem we’re having, you always bring it back around to “getting out of this town and starting over.”</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We should get out of this town and start over.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that’s not the solution to everything.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I never said it was the solution to everything.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">The kitchen sink backed up and your solution was to get out of town and start over again.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wasn’t presenting it as a solution to the sink.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course you weren’t. But you never hesitate to bring it up do you?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Peter, honestly I don’t. Do you know why? Because we should get out of town and start over again.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Our lives are here, our kids go to school here, my sister is here, her kids are here.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t mean we have to stay here.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I realize you don’t understand the importance of family because yours was so dysfunctional-</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa!</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">-But it’s important. And it’s important in way that nobody anticipates.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re seriously going to stand there and accuse me of not knowing the importance of family after giving birth to not one, but TWO of your children?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not what I’m saying-</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds like that’s what you’re saying.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t put words in my mouth.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t need to put words in your mouth. “You don’t understand the importance of family,” that’s what you said.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stephanie, it’s not just our kids. It’s everyone. My sister, her kids, this town, we rely on these people and they rely on us.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t rely on these people.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course we do.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">At least once a day someone from this town comes to you with a problem for you to clean up. Who said that was your job? There’s a reason this town doesn’t have a mayor, Peter. It doesn’t need one.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine, fine. Let’s hear it. Let’s hear your solution, then.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are we moving to?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Peter-</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, no, we’re going to sell the motel and then pack up the covered wagon, right? I’m sure you have this all figured out because you can’t stop bringing it up, so what’s the plan?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re supposed to come up with the plan together.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Propose something to me. Anything. Pick a city in the Northern Hemisphere. Let’s go.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t just pick a city-</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">No you can’t. Do you know why? Because this escape plan of yours, starting over in a new town, it completely falls apart when we’re confronted with a little thing called reality.... What would we do there? Could the kids walk to school like they do now? Are there even schools nearby? Can we afford to live there? Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are answers to all of those questions.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are answers to all of those questions. I guarantee you this escape plan of yours will collapse in on itself as soon as you get an answer you don’t like... You’re in favor of leaving so long as there are no complications and everything goes our way. When, in the history of the world, has that ever happened?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What room are we arguing in?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seven.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Let’s go.</p>
<p class="direction">PETER AND STEPHANIE WALK INTO ROOM SEVEN AND CLOSE THE DOOR.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sheesh. Frank?</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE WALKS INTO THE OFFICE.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How are you?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Just great.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay... There was kind of a crazy scene out there. I think a couple checked in to try and work out their marital problems, do you know them?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Who are they?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s Peter and Stephanie Sturgis. My mother and father.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Your mother and father?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank... Frank didn’t you tell me that your father passed away?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well what... Frank, what’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">My parents were very protective. They were very concerned about fighting in front of us. They thought it would be traumatic.</p>
<p class="dialogue">So they had this habit... When they needed to have a fight they would get a sitter and then stay here. They would fight all night long and then come back the next day like nothing had happened... I got wise to it when I was twelve... I always wondered what they were fighting about...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s... that’s them in that car?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What car?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean what... The car is gone.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just wait.</p>
<p class="direction">OUTSIDE WE HEAR THE SAME CAR APPROACH AGAIN. WE HEAR PETER AND STEPHANIE GET OUT OF THE CAR AND REPEAT THE SAME ARGUMENT THEY JUST HAD.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh God... How long has this been happening?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It started this morning.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the bathroom.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who is that?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What is she doing here?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Clementine what are you doing here?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was just...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, June has a theory.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE What?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">June, you have a theory?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You did this, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">As you can imagine, we’re starting to go a little crazy around here.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not crazy, you’re crazy.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was... when we first met you, when you were lying in the parking lot and we took you to the hospital, June and I waited for a while. There was this weird thing that happened. One of the nurses kept calling for Nr. Nate. She did it over and over again. June now thinks that it was-</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a time loop!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She thinks it was a time loop. Which she got from a Star Trek episode.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what if it’s a Star Trek episode!? Tell her about the car.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there was a car that kept driving by the motel, over and over again, she thinks that was another one. And now...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And now there’s a literal Outer Limits episode happening in our parking lot!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And she says it’s because of you.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It all started when you showed up, Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve gone through several stages with this today. Shock, horror, disbelief... Here at the end of the day I think we’ve drifted now into resignation? I think we’re just waiting for it to stop so we can start pretending it never happened.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why doesn’t she make it stop? She’s the one who made it happen?!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">June, come out of the bathroom.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No way! Not with her out there!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">This isn’t her fault, June, You’re being ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">YOU’RE being ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t just blame someone because they’re new in town.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know I’m right, Frank!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody knows anything about anything, my dead father is arguing in the parking lot, June!</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s right.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>

<p class="direction">BATHROOM DOOR OPENS.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s me... I did it.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, you’re a strange person but this is-</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A bar of gold, Frank? I just had that on me? I brought beer from Tokyo and didn’t know it was in Japan. I disappeared from the hospital. How did I disappear from the hospital?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And these are all strange things but-</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine, here’s another bar of gold.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE SUDDENLY HAS A BAR OF GOLD IN HER HAND. SHE TOSSES IT ONTO THE FRONT DESK.</p>

<p class="direction">ANOTHER GOLD BAR LANDS ON THE DESK.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still not convinced? I can make my favorite song play out of thin air, how about that?</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR STELLA SPLENDENS FAINTLY PLAYING FROM NOWHERE.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where is that coming from?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can do anything I want... Anything I want except for the thing I want to do... It’s terrible.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, look, you may think-</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ, do you still not believe me? Fine, there’s a chicken in the bathroom now.</p>
<p class="direction">A CHICKEN SUDDENLY CLUCKS FROM THE BATHROOM.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh fuck! Shit, there’s a fucking chicken in here... there’s-</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that? Is that good enough?... I think I broke Frank.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this a living chicken, we just have a chicken now?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Enjoy... Okay, I’m going to go outside and I’m going to put things right again. And then I’m going to go before I break something else... Or break everything...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you going to do?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait-</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE WALKS OUTSIDE JUST AS THE CAR IS PULLING UP AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I really am sorry, you two. (To herself.) Time is the substance I am made of. Time is a river that sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me... but I am the fire.</p>
<p class="direction">TWO MORE OF THE EXACT SAME CAR PULL INTO THE PARKING LOT. PETER AND STEPHANIE GET OUT OF THOSE CARS AS WELL AND BEGIN TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENT THEY’VE BEEN HAVING. WE ARE NOW HEARING THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENT FROM THEM OVERLAPPED THREE TIMES.</p>

<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell?!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine this doesn’t look like “fixing things”.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not supposed to happen.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">None of this is supposed to happen!</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t understand.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s three of my aunt and uncle now. There’s not supposed to be any of them.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay wait, wait just wait... Let me try again... Time is the substance I am made of. Time is a river that sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which destroys me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me... but I am the fire.</p>
<p class="direction">THREE MORE IDENTICAL CARS PULL INTO THE PARKING LOT, PETER AND STEPHANIE EMERGE FROM THOSE CARS AS WELL. WE ARE NOW HEARING THE SAME CONVERSATION SIX TIMES.</p>

<p class="dialogue">From where?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I... I’m going to go. I’m going to go get help. Frank, listen... I’m so sorry... I thought I could control it... I thought I was in control... I’ll be back, I promise.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Yes, I can see that, Zeb.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are we to know which ones are the real ones?</p>

<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, tell me exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was one car, it kept showing up. That’s Frank’s mother and father in the car. His father passed away, this is a scene from their past.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then how did it become six cars?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I tried to fix it, it usually works when I try to fix things.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you try to fix it?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s this thing I say. I say it when I need to focus.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Borges?</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jorge Borges. He’s a writer, you were reciting Borges?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know who that is. It’s something my mother taught me to recite when I was panicking. It seemed to work when I needed to focus on something.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, guess what, it’s not working.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is happening?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. It’s a lot. Sure. Don’t panic. First of all, let me say that I really love your motel. Very mid-century modern, very Lost Highway.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is happening?!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, let’s just first-paragraph-of-wikipedia this, shall we? We’re Midnight Burger, a time-traveling dimension-spanning diner. We’ve been trying to hunt down a mysterious red-headed woman who has been fucking up the cosmos. Sound familiar?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Turns out, when she was taking a break from destroying all of existence she liked to hang out here. I mean, why wouldn’t she? It’s lovely. Where are we, Washington?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oregon.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. So, the problem is, Clementine eventually destabilizes everything around her, including this place.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Destabilizes how?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, you know how things have a tendency to... exist?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re aware.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">She tends to make them stop doing that.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You guys are going to stop that though, right?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is a diner going to stop that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we don’t know yet, BUT we’ve got two very smart people, a 700 year old man, two baptist ministers and a very competent restaurant manager so the answer’s got to be in there somewhere, right?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you do?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I used to work at the DMV and now I’m trying to figure it all out, it’s a process.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi there.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, this is Gloria, she’s runs the place.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice to meet you. Welcome to the weirdest day of your life.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, I hope it is.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a lot. Sure. But I think you’ll find that your capacity for weird shit is way higher than you think it is.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What... what happens now?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we’ve got about a half dozen temporal anomalies don’t we? Who are the two people in these cars?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s... it’s my mom and dad.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And is this them in the present?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. My dad passed away. My mom lives in New Mexico now.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, so they definitely shouldn’t be here and there definitely shouldn’t be six pairs of them, right?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve got to stay away from me... How are you even here?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a long story.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did I do to you... did I... did I make you American?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, no, I’ve-</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the pillars of salt all over again. You’ve got to stay away from me.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, listen-</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t, Terric, please.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE RUNS OFF.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Let’s not make this too complicated. If we get all the Moms and Dads inside the diner, that should solve the problem, as long as we can keep them in there long enough.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It seems like they can’t even see us, though.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve got to make them see us. Also, the hard part is, we can’t just drag them in here, we’ve got to convince them to go into the diner.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just trust me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. So, mom and dad had some martial problems?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, I mean, they never split up but they did fight a lot.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">My mom said she never understood their relationship.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She did?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Did you?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I guess not.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. We’ve got six rooms. Everybody take a room and try to convince them to have a cup of coffee at the diner that just appeared in the parking lot.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, are you seriously asking this particular group of people to help them work out their marital problems?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Show of hands, who here feels comfortable being a marriage counselor?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well, both of our hands are up.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, we’re never the right people for any situation we’re in, we’re just the only ones around.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fair point.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to hate this.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everybody pick a room. Let’s go.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gloria, I’ll take a room.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You should probably talk to Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">She ran off somewhere. I think maybe we should fix whatever problem this is first.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure, it could get pretty weird in there.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because of the temporal anomalies?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you have to help someone with their marriage.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a degree in Psychology.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You do?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m a seven hundred year old scholar, Gloria, I’ve got a degree in pretty much everything.</p>

<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s been a while, but I’m sure it’ll come back to me.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, uh, lobotomies are bad now.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great, I’m updated.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get in there.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. I’m about to go help someone with their marriage.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which should be the beginning of a joke.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But instead it’s a real thing that’s happening.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Caspar, I’m about to get in there as well and the word marriage makes me literally start packing a suitcase for no reason.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is going to be ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m taking room seven, come do this with me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Terric’s going to help so we can double up.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to help your success rate in there.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know but when it goes wrong I can blame you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, June, you can probably be a lot of help here because you actually knew them. I know you think you’re going crazy but we really need you to pick a room and try and make something happen.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uncle Pete died not too long ago now, it’s... it’s a lot.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus. Right, um... Well, here’s something that I’ve learned in this completely nuts situation that I’m in... It’s all happening. It’s all happening right now. The past, the future, they’re all just pages in a book. But the whole book is right in front of you. There’s an opportunity here. Because you’ve read the book. Which means you can go back to the beginning and see the story in a completely different way. You get to talk to the past from the future. Maybe since you know the end, you have something to say about the beginning.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re a restaurant manager?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I prefer Taquera, but that’s fine.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if none of this works? Are we going to be stuck like this forever?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never seen anything last forever. But how about we don’t think about failure right now?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which room are we taking?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s go with number one, I guess.</p>
<p class="direction">ROOM 9. TERRIC IS IN SESSION.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is ridiculous. We’re just going around in circles again.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hear you, Peter, let’s try and start again. Stephanie, you mentioned wanting to move to a new town, and Peter, you have strong ties to this community. Can you both share your perspectives?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I've been feeling the need for a fresh start. This is a small town. A VERY small town, I can walk across the entire town in an afternoon.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not true, the town is much bigger than that-</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Peter, please, you’ll have your turn, let’s hear from Stephanie right now.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re trying to raise kids. Kids need to be exposed to things. There’s only so many things they can be exposed to in a town that only exists because of an onslaught of skiers every winter.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Peter, can you understand her position?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exposing them to things cuts both ways. There’s a lot going on in bigger cities, maybe things we don’t want to expose them to.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what he does, every time we talk about this he imagines we’re moving to some urban hellscape that he saw in a movie one time.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">We saw Death Wish in the the theater and it was very disturbing.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wasn’t a documentary, Peter.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Peter, you seem to have deep roots in this community, can you tell me what these roots mean to you?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I grew up here, my parents still live here, and I've built strong relationships here. It feels like home, and leaving it behind feels like abandoning a part of myself.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Stephanie, I’m sure you can understand that.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, his parents living here is not the selling point he thinks it is.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">She just doesn’t understand that because she doesn’t get along with her parents.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Or your parents, but who’s counting?</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we’re not going to get anywhere by disqualifying each other’s feelings.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re right, I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is good, though. I feel like we’re moving in the right direction. Now we need to try and look for some common ground, okay?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Coming from the neighboring room.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh Jesus Christ you’re as rigid as a fucking cadaver!!</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yikes. Glad we’re not those two.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know who they are but they sound like a mess.</p>
<p class="direction">ROOM SEVEN. CASPAR AND AVA. IT’S A MESS. CASPAR AND AVA LISTEN OUTSIDE THE DOOR.</p>
<p class="character">PETER (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really? A cadaver? Well that’s a new one!</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no room to breathe with you!</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, which one of us isn’t breathing, I thought I was the cadaver.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was a good one.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything, EVERYTHING Has to be a certain way. From the laundry to the lives of our kids.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I’m sorry that I don’t want to spend our lives like its unstructured “me time” at some sort of Dutch primary school!</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that even mean?!</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve done everything I can to make us a life here! Nothing makes you happy!</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who could be happy here, Peter? Who in their right mind?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m happy here.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh, got him.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">So we’ve raised our children in a town that you think is full of idiots.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. It’s perfect for them because they’re idiots too.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Heh. Kids are dumb.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did my moms talk about me this way?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I sure hope so.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">How come they’re not noticing each other or noticing a huge diner in the parking lot?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The mind does some pretty crazy things to keep operating. I imagine they’re tuning out a lot right now.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">They should tune each other out, they sound like they’re about to kill each other.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s get in there.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY OPEN THE DOOR.</p>
<p class="direction">CASPAR (CONT’D) Hey there!</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Excuse me, can I help you?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, we were next door.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were next door and we couldn’t help but hear the shouting.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, everything okay over here?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does it sound like it’s okay?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds hilarious.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds like you’re having some trouble.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re fine, alright? We just need some privacy.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, when I’m having troubles sometimes I like to have a cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A what?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">A nice cup of coffee. Nothing makes a wrong situation right like a cup of coffee, you know what I mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you doing a Sanka ad?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe you should head over to that diner there and have a cup of coffee?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Diner?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re wasting your time, this man has no vices. He’s like a Mormon without the magic underwear.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you see what I have to put up with?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, it looks like a lot.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Getting obliterated by your wife is a full time job.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">But every marriage has it’s challenges right?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Think how challenging it is for her to come up with sick burns all the time.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What I’m saying is... look, you obviously care about each other very much and it’s confusing because she-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is hilarious.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">-Has an odd way of showing affection. I mean, you both do, you’re both attacking each other-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s just better at it, and I’m sure that’s rough for you.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we helping or are you having a little comedy festival over there?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Both?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s difficult when this happens. I feel like I’m trying to talk about the issue and she’s just trying to win some sort of contest.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I don’t know if that’s entirely fair, Pete, but I hear what you’re saying. I mean, it’s tough. You obviously care about her very much but also she appears to covered in tiny poisonous barbs.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Excuse me?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Speaking metaphorically. Metaphorical poisonous barbs.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not much better.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you get it. Right? Some people cover themselves with a spiky personality to keep the shitheads away but the spikes do not retract, that’s not how tiny poisonous barbs work. They’re always there, which puts you in the position to just keep getting stung, and develop an immunity to the poison spikes.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we get away from the poison spikes analogy?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you know you can’t help yourself. You can’t help but reach out to her, you feel compelled to, call that whatever you like. You come to get used to the fact that getting close to her involves a certain amount of injury to yourself.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Stephanie, you’re over there saying “Really? Him?</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is the guy?” Because you had already imagined the guy who would keep coming back, and you imagined he would be, I don’t know, better? You’ve created this person in your mind and they’re this great combination of the genius of Marie Curie and the unbridled hotness of Michael Faraday.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But he does keeps coming back... And you admire that a little and then you also hate him because you admire it. And then there’s this other terrible moment where you realize that it’s nice to be wanted. And you also hate THAT. Which makes you even more mad. And it’s made even worse by the fact that he SUCKS. And he has fucked up so many times, especially that one time, you know the time I’m talking about.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’ve apologized, Pete. You really have, you’ve tried to make up for that one time when you fucked up really bad but, y’know, that doesn’t matter because apologizing doesn’t mean that your apology has been accepted. It doesn’t mean that she’s under any obligation to accept your apology, all you can really do is apologize and hope for the best, and try to do better right? That’s how you feel.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not sure-</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You spend a lot of time studying the universe, Stephanie.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And in your studies you’ve come to terms with chaos. You can’t control what the universe brings you. You’re an island.</p>
<p class="dialogue">All you have at your disposal are the trees and tiny creatures that live on your island, and whatever the ocean washes up on your shore. What washes up on the shore is mostly garbage, but sometimes it’s useful and sometimes it’s something you didn’t know you needed.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I’m not sure if I need this.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure you’re talking about us?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re absolutely talking about you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Definitely.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh...</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">You said there was coffee across the way?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes! Go have some.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s great coffee.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe they’ll be gone when we get back?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good idea.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, well, nice to meet you.</p>

<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right, because of your pores.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because of what it does to my pores. So what I like to do is, early in the morning, after I do my Ashtanga vinyasa, I open up all the doors and windows in the house and I let that morning air in, I release all that stale air that I’ve been breathing all night. It’s wonderful, I breathe in that air and I can smell the mesquite groves all around the house, it’s really a gift.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="dialogue">Pete, how are you? You’re on with Dr. Barbara.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m what with who?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pete, I hear that you and your wife are going through a bit of a time right now, is that safe to say?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? Who is this?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, Pete, there’s nothing more complicated than a marriage. Nothing in the world. You can talk to me about the human nervous system or weather patterns or particle physics, but no, it’s two people trying to make a life long commitment to each other, that is the final frontier if you ask me.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t believe I am asking you.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pete, I’m going to perform a little test. I’m going to ask you what the root problem is with your marriage and you’re going to try and answer, are you ready?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are you talking to?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, apparently I’m on the radio.</p>

<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">How would I know?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>

<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What test, what is she talking about?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, she’s asking me what the root problem is with our marriage.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ha! Well, that’s some fun serendipity, isn’t it? What’d you say?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I haven’t said anything, I just picked up the phone.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s your answer?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to answer her question.</p>

<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s Dr. Barbara, Stephanie.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dr. Barbara. Perfect. Come on, Pete. Let it rip.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">I will not let it rip.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stephanie, would you like to go first?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely not, I want to hear this.</p>

<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry?</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, then.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">You heard me.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you hear what he said, Frank?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I heard him, he said restlessness.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s so interesting, isn’t it Frank?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know I’m interested.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell us more about that word you chose, Pete. Restlessness.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have a good life here. It may be a small life, it may be in a small town on the side of a large mountain but it’s a good life. Good lives are hard to come by and I think we should be grateful for the one we have rather than leaving it because we think another one might be better.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And Stephanie, do you have anything to say to that?</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think a good life is subjective. I think what’s good for one person is not necessarily good for another. He’s talking about it like it’s this objective truth that I just don’t understand.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, do you see what I mean about the complexity, Frank?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got a headache just thinking about it.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Every human being is a story, kids. Frank, do you remember our first show together?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">I sure do, Doc. You stopped the whole show and said “Frank, what’s your story?”</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Somehow it ended with me giving the audience my chili recipe.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oooh I remember that chili, so spicy!</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re talking about chili now.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kids, I think the most important thing to remember right now is that all of this fighting is good. Conflict is just a relationship trying to grow, and the longer you talk, the greater the chance of the other person making sense. Everybody makes sense if you listen long enough.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can’t seem to do that without it turning into a shouting match.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see, Frank what do I have to say to that?</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Time to take it on the road.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right Frank, take this conversation to a public place. Maybe go have a cup of coffee. It’ll be harder to scream at each other if you’re worried about your server calling the police.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s actually not a bad idea.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s completely unsolicited advice but it’s not bad advice.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good. I’m excited you two. I’m excited what this next phase will bring and I know Frank’s excited too.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

What’s the real thing that’s happening? There’s a lot going on right now. A diner’s appeared in your parking lot, but what’s the real thing?

<p class="dialogue">Ok, ha ha, everybody laugh at the fish thief, fine. What’s the point you’re trying to make?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The point is, you two didn’t fight about that. He had to bail you out of jail for the most ridiculous crime in the history of the state of Oregon and you didn’t fight about it.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course we didn’t, she was right.</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was right.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">See? You think that’s a typical response? It’s not. You are the only person who would steal fish from a grocery store as some sort of ridiculous social protest and HE’s the only guy who wouldn’t get mad about it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, let’s do Pete now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pete, we should probably talk about Boodles.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God, I forgot about Boodles.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You adopted a dog named Boodles, didn’t you Pete?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes, I adopted a Dog named Boodles.</p>

<p class="direction">STEPHANIE Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What gives, Pete?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was going to be euthanized, he had stayed at the shelter too long.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see, that’s very noble. Can you think of any reason why Boodles had been at the shelter too long?</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There was a smell.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">“There was a smell.”</p>
<p class="character">STEPHANIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Saying that dog had a smell is like saying the Beatles were fairly well known.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I did.</p>

<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">It did not.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, Boodles was a very old dog. But he did hang in there for three years, didn’t he? All the while stinking up the whole house.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was the kind of smell that felt like punishment from God or a fairy’s curse or something. It was not a natural smell.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was bad.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You had to keep the windows in the house open in the winter time.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not all of the windows.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a tough time in the house.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And through it all, you never argued about the dog.</p>
<p class="direction">STEPHANIE No.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The point I’m trying to make here is... Can you knock it off please? Can you stop it with the arguing all the time? All you’re doing is playing around with the idea that you’re going to break up, but you’re never going to. Because you both drive each other crazy, but on the important stuff, on the salmon stealing and the stinky old dog stuff, that’s the stuff you couldn’t find somewhere else... So, stop it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What we should probably also say is, people really love you guys. They love to gossip about you but, I don’t think they would know what to do without you.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys. Go home. You don’t have to do this anymore. Go home. Your kids already know you’re here fighting. Go fight in front of them. They already know you’re not breaking up. They might appreciate the honesty.</p>
<p class="character">PETER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you talk to your parents this way?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No... but I should have. Go home.</p>

<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re welcome, dummy.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What did you do?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t do much of anything. I just told you what to do.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you know what to do?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m really smart, Clementine. The more power you have the more knowledge you have to have. The more you can do, the more you need to know what you should do. If you don’t you get a universe full of Hyundai Sonatas.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Is it over?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not yet. The next part is the most important part. You and Terric are going to go down to the diner, sit at a booth and you’re going to drink coffee and eat pancakes until we’ve sucked all the terrible bullshit out of you. It could take a while, you’re full of a lot of bullshit.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that going to do to her?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, I’m not sure.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t matter. I’ll do it. I have to.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Let’s get off this roof then. You need to go down and apologize to literally everyone.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Okay.</p>
<p class="character">EFFIE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dear, we’ve got to put some music on because that was a whole dang experience.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>
<p class="dialogue">Agreed, dear.</p>
<p class="direction">SONG:</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Anyway, you’ll see these triangular yellow drones from Toferius sometimes. They hover for a minute of so, grab some data and then they’re gone, it’s no big deal.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What kind of data are they grabbing?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They make maps. They’re nuts about maps, the whole planet, it’s weird.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Leif, do you mind if I talk to Frank and June for a second?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No problem. Nice to meet you two.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, guys.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey... So... Apparently Leif used to be a Space Pirate.</p>
<p class="direction">CLEMENTINE Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Normal shit.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, it is the most normal thing we’ve heard today.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s true.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the radio?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, I don’t think anyone actually knows the story there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re telling us that you were just trying to get home.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was. I could travel anywhere I wanted except back home. So, I kept changing things in my past, hoping it would lead me back there. In the process I... caused all this. Now I’ll never get back there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And home was in the future?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not your future. Another future of another Earth. It’s hard to explain.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I get it.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You do?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Because I watched Star Trek. Who’s laughing now?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m so sorry.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess now I understand why you were never honest with us.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, in a strange way I guess it all makes sense now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, it doesn’t make SENSE sense.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">But it makes sense.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you both for being so nice to me this whole time. I really did like it here.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, Clementine, you may not ever get home but that doesn’t mean you’ll never “be home” y’know? You heard my mom, she hated it here, but she made us her home. Sometimes home isn’t a place.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there. Mind if I butt in? I need to debrief the motel people before we go.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. I need to make a bunch of apologies anyway.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bye Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">So. Hi.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you’re, like, the doctor of the ship right?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not a ship.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you’re like the smart person with the ideas.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">See? Star Trek again. I’m lapping you.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wanted to mention something before we go. Uh... We may have fixed things here but there’s actually no such thing as a fixed thing.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, some weird shit went down. We fixed it but there may be some... residual effects.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Residual effects?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Things may still be a little weird around here.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Things are always weird around here.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. This would be a new category of weird.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What exactly does this new category of weird look like?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really no idea. Just keep a look out for that, okay?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Okay.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh and, Frank? Clementine told me that at one point she... disintegrated your body... and then she reconstructed your body from ambient molecules in the atmosphere?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She... I’m sorry she what now?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Reconstructed your body after disintegrating it.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you look like you’re doing great so just... keep a lookout for that as well.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. When I look at you I literally feel every human emotion and it’s overwhelming so I just need to say something.</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Actually I think I already said the thing I needed to say, it was the every human emotion thing. I put the cart before the horse. I guess I’m trying to say-</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine. I’m going to stand here in this parking lot until this place starts traveling through the space time continuum because it’s really an amazing thing to see. Then you and I are going to go inside and have pancakes. Okay?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This parking lot was full of cars and then you talked to Clementine and all the cars disappeared, what kind of Kriss Angel nonsense is that?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve told you for years that I am a sorcerer and you don’t listen to me. But I shouldn’t be surprised because you never listen to me.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">I listen to you all the time. It’s not my fault that I only understand thirty percent of the things you say.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thirty percent is generous.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s tricky with you physics people because you have these cool names for things that turn out to be super boring like Monstrous Moonshine.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Monstrous Moonshine is fascinating.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does it involve either monsters or moonshine? No, it does not, it’s a total misnomer and I think the physics community should watch itself.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, stop for a second.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I want to talk to you about something.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m concerned with some things you’ve been saying lately.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What things when?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">When we were in the deep freeze...</p>
<p class="direction">WE BEGIN TO HEAR A FAMILIAR SOUND IN THE DISTANCE.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Ava?... Ava, what’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sound.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you hear that?</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, maybe. I think I hear something.</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hear it.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s Chuck.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s Chuck? 4th dimensional being Chuck? He has theme music now? Like Foxy Brown?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a sound we heard the last time he showed up.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the time before that.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Well, he’s the one who sent us on this wild ride looking for Clementine, maybe he wants to congratulate us now. Maybe this is the loot chest at the end of the adventure.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Gloria.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>

<p class="dialogue">He’s killing her.</p>
<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why? It’s over, we won!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The point wasn’t to stop her. He just wanted us to wear her down and then flush her out so he could-</p>

<p class="dialogue">PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!</p>
<p class="character">TERRIC</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do something!</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">We were his fucking hunting dogs.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="dialogue">Somebody give me some options!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Uh... Leif! Go up on the roof and turn on the wind chimes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">AVA</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it may distract him, it may buy us some time.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m going.</p>
<p class="character">CASPAR</p>
<p class="dialogue">This was his plan the whole goddamn time. We can’t let her just die.</p>

<p class="character">GLORIA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine, you teleported the diner to get us here, can you do it again?</p>
<p class="character">CLEMENTINE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t... I can’t I’m too weak.</p>
<p class="character">ZEBULON</p>

<p class="dialogue">How?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh God, it’s starting again. OOOOOW!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Mad?</p>
<p class="direction">GLORIA WALKS INSIDE THE DINER AND MAKES A B-LINE FOR THE KITCHEN. SHE PICKS UP A SPATULA AND REPEATEDLY BANGS IT ON THE GRILL.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey! I’m talking to you!... There’s a girl out there that’s about to be killed while you’re just sitting here. Are you listening to me?!... I know you’re listening to me. I know you listen to us all the time. I know we talk about how this place is random and just pops up in random places, but it doesn’t. You don’t do that do you?... In fact, I’m guessing nothing you do is random... I know you’re listening. I know you’re paying attention. There are guajillo peppers in that walk-in that you put there and I’ll bet my life you didn’t start doing that until I showed up. You’re listening. I’m guessing you have some sort of plan that we’ll never know, some great mystery, right? Well, I’m sick of it. I’m getting batted around by two forces out of my control: Chuck the 4th dimensional asshole... and you... Whatever you are... And frankly, getting batted around by forces out of my control? I had enough of that back home and I’m not doing it again. So here’s the deal. Whatever it is you’re up to? You need me. I know you do. You need all of us. And none of us are going to stand for you letting a girl die in the parking lot... You need us, so you need to start acting like it... Move... Now... Take this girl home.</p>
