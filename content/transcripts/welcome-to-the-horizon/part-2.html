<p class="dialogue">Morning.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Got everything you need over there?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who has everything they need?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good point. Everything you need within reason?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it always this quiet here?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">This time of year, yeah. It’s the off season. In a few months there’ll be a bunch of skiers on their way up the mountain.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that about?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Skiing? It’s a universal law of nature. When there’s a big thing there will be, inevitably, a portion of the population that wants to go very fast down the side of it.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I notice you don’t have a car. I’m going to run into town for some supplies, do you need us to pick you up anything?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got everything I need, thanks.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK’S TRUCK COMES SPEEDING UP THE DRIVEWAY INTO THE PARKING LOT. JUNE JUMPS OUT OF THE DRIVER’S SEAT. SHE’S ON THE PHONE.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh-huh... Oh no... Oh God that sucks... And you looked everywhere?... Uh-huh. I’m so sorry. (To Frank.) Edgy Steve.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, good.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Back to the phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, we haven’t seen anything but we’ll keep our eyes open, okay... I’m sure he’ll turn up... okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know Steve’s dog?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Rambo?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. He’s missing.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? Doesn’t he keep him on a lawn spike most of the time?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, he woke up this morning and he was gone. He’s losing his mind.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How upset are we supposed to be about this?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That dog is a fucking monster.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s the meanest dog I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, of course it is, Frank, it guards the house of a drug dealer. Drug dealers all have terrifying dogs, it’s the law.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, so his terrifying dog is now loose in town somewhere?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds like it.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s such a blight on the community, this guy.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Steve’s fine. He keeps you on your toes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How can we get him to move his business to another town?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, get skiers to stop liking methamphetamines?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does he expect us to do about it?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I told him we’d keep a look out.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell him to follow the trail of murdered cats.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway... Hi, Verge.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi there.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s everything going over there?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just fine.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you... what are you smoking there, Verge?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tobacco’s really fantastic.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hear it’s popular. (To Frank.) Do we have a theory on what Verge’s deal is?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m kind of stumped. It’s been three days now and they just hang out in their room and occasionally come outside and roll a cigarette.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Roll a cigarette?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like a cowboy?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t say cowboy, I’m still not over our cowboy experience the other day.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, but be real with me, I feel a little cooler that they’re just hanging out here, right?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hate to admit it, but yeah, maybe a little.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How can we become a hot spot for cool drifters?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve met our share of drifters, this is definitely the first one that’s been cool.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">True. Okay, we doing this? Breakfast? Sheep’s Eye?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Hey, Verge. If anyone wants to check in can you just tell them to pick a room, key’s in the bedside table, we’ll deal with them later?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, also, no one’s going to want to check in so don’t worry about it.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That I can handle.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fantastic.</p>
<p class="direction">BREAKFAST RUSH AT THE SHEEP’S EYE. FRANK AND JUNE ARE SITTING OUTSIDE. DEIDRE BRINGS THEM THEIR ORDER.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we’ve got bacon, eggs, and toast.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Amazing.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And granola and fruit for Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Loser.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Deidre, how’s everyone doing?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are they doing? You mean after the “Relentless Rick Incident”?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, everyone’s working really hard to explain it away. Celeste is saying it was some sort of government experiment being conducted on us. What’s “MK Ultra?”</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Never mind, forget I asked.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you doing, Deidre?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me? Uh, fine? I think I’m in denial? That’s normal right?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Totally.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. Frank, do you still want me to tell you about weird stuff?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um, I really don’t, but why don’t you tell me anyway?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess this isn’t WEIRD weird, but, it looks like Trinkett’s coming back to town.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seriously?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh boy.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, she called to make sure I still had her keys.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s been a while, where was she calling from?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She said, Cairo?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s terrible news.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fine. When is she coming back?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She didn’t say.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re right, that’s not WEIRD weird, but thank you for the warning anyway.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is going to be fun for me.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, Deidre. Steve’s dog is loose apparently.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Rambo?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That dog is terrifying.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, Steve woke up this morning and he was gone.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s bad.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not great, so if you’re going for a walk or something, I guess take your bear spray with you?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Or a leg of lamb, y’know, to distract him.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jeez. Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you see him, call Steve.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Is there any way I can not call Steve?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Call me. Call me and I’ll call him.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Awesome.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... So, local mystic Trinket Coralee, coming back to town.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Horrible timing.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett Coralee, Purveyor of ancient cures and strange smells.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why does she have to come back to town right now? Of all the people I don’t want to deal with.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never understood the issue with you two, why do you hate each other?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t hate each other, she’s just an aggravating person.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are weird things afoot in town though. Might be nice to have the perspective of a... whatever she calls herself.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The last thing anyone needs right now is her drawing some sort of summoning circle in the middle of town to focus the spiritual energies or some bullshit.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think it’s going to be nice. My chakras are going to get so aligned.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is such bad news.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, speaking of weird shit, how are we feeling?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... y’know...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay we’ve got to find a way to talk about this with less long pauses and allusions.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you want me to say, Frank?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Look, I wake up in the morning, I look in the mirror, it’s me. I’m not growing roots or something, I’m not turning into a werewolf. It’s me.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. I mean, I’m fine with “New Frank”.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t say “New Frank.”</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Meet the new Frank.</p>

<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">He woke up this morning, no sign of him.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, boy.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Has he run off before?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, he hates going outside. You practically have to drag him behind you when you walk him.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s two.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s just a coincidence.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s just a coincidence?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing. Rambo’s missing too, apparently. I got a call from Steve this morning.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What? Rambo?!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, what?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">My Dad’s dog is wandering around out there while Steve’s insane monster is roaming the streets?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Rambo’s not that bad, Doug.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">He bit through his leash one time.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s... that is true, that is true.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a chain leash, June.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doug we’re all going to keep an eye out, okay? Rambo probably took off into the woods to bring down an elk or something.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>

<p class="dialogue">I just wanted to sit here and have some granola.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well there’s something that no one’s ever said.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two missing dogs.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just a coincidence.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s going to be a third.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, don’t catch Doug’s anxiety.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We need to learn how to catch these things earlier.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to go talk to everyone.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everybody... Everybody listen up... Thank you. You may have heard that Rambo has gone missing. Now, while that presents it’s own problems, seeing as how Rambo is a fucking psychopath, Baron Munchausen is also missing. I need to know right now if anyone else is missing a dog or if you’ve heard of anyone else that is missing a dog... Anybody?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, I would like to say something.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please, don’t.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We all remember what happened a few days ago. We were visited by, what can only be described as, a time traveller. An old west outlaw by the name of Relentless Rick. While not all of you subscribe to my theory that we were all drugged as part of an experiment by the nearby secret military base-</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no secret military base.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">-Agree to disagree. You may not all agree with my theory. But now there’s missing dogs. And I think we can all agree that these dogs are being stolen by the local secret military base and being experimented on.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can all agree?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we just going to sit here while there is a rash of dog theft sweeping across town?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s two dogs.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">For now. For now it is, but look at Frank here. Look at him. If this wasn’t something for us to be worried about, Frank wouldn’t be making a speech about it, would he? Would you, Frank?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>

Nothing to panic about. Let’s all just keep our eyes out for Rambo and Baron Munchausen. We’ll find them and then everything can get back to normal.</p>

Of course what I really hope is that you somehow managed to stop running... that somehow life is different for you... you deserved a different life... Anyway, I think you’d like this place. I think it might hold your attention. Earth always felt like a prison for me but for you... who knows?</p>

<p class="dialogue">... I hate it when you’re right... Eldin, deploy a sensor dome on this location, play some nice music and wake me up in seven hours.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sensor dome deployed. Anything on the agenda tomorrow?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A very interesting breakfast.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alarm set for seven hours. Goodnight, Verge.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goodnight.</p>
<p class="end">THE END.</p>
