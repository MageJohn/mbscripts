<p class="direction">WE START IN VERGE’S ROOM. ELDIN LAYS IT ALL OUT ON THE TABLE FOR FRANK.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was a surprising amount of orthodoxy when it came to xenobiology in The Triad. For a very long time, the only version of life scientists were willing to talk about was the same model we’re all used to: organic compounds in, waste out, all of that fueling a centralized neural cluster. Now never mind that there were already examples that contradicted that model. You’re in the same room with one of them right now.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi there.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Vapians have a central brain like you do but further down the abdomen are two sub-brains that help coordinate the additional appendages and can take on an additional work load in times of high demand. Octopuses on your planet are the same way. But the orthodoxy continued on for many a cycle and any xenobiologist who dared to challenge it was summarily sent to the fringes of the science. It wasn’t until an unauthorized treatise written by a xenobiologist known only as “The Gentleman” began to circulate through the community that minds began to change. In the treatise, it’s proposed that there was a viable alternative to the “organics in, organics out” model. It was called the “energy accumulation” model. Energy is everywhere to be harnessed. It need not be through biological processing that complexity be achieved. It reads “Here we stand, my fellows, with advancements our ancestors could not dream of, and still... life... the simplest thing, the most prevalent, the most mysterious.”</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin, this is lovely but can we move it along a little?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Gentleman suggested a life form that was simply an accumulation of energy, no real physical form except for a simple locus around which the energy could coalesce. As the energy accumulates, complexity is achieved, and sentience emerges.</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was all theoretical for years, but then one day, in an unexplored arm of Triangulum, there they were. The Orbus. A core of energy surrounded by a crystalline shell. They hovered wherever they went, communicated telepathically, and sustained themselves by absorbing ambient cosmic radiation.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nicest people you’ll ever meet.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, they are quite lovely.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re... orbs.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct. They are a strange race and very rare, but, y’know, that’s Triangulum.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does this have to do with me?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Life, as we know it, takes many forms. All of them valid. It doesn’t sound to me like you’ve been cursed or turned into some sort of abomination by your encounter with this woman Clementine. It sounds as though she, unwittingly, created a new form of life, and placed you inside the prototype.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I liked being human.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We all strive toward the familiar, Frank. It’s understandable. But if I may be so bold, I think you’ll come to enjoy this new shape you’re in. You get to test drive a new form of life. It’s a rare privilege.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">A form of life that was created accidentally.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That describes most forms of life, even your former species. A chain of proteins makes a wrong turn one day in the primordial ooze. Next thing you know they’re walking around having existential crises all day.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t want to be an orb, Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not suggesting you’re an orb, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I eat breakfast in the morning like everyone else.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I think you should continue to do that. We don’t know exactly how you work yet, it’s going to take some time. We know spores have no effect on you, we know you’re not sleeping, we know you can somehow survive a fall of about a hundred meters—but there’s much more to learn. I’ll monitor you, make notes, it’ll be fun.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think your glee is kind of freaking him out, Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I’m sure it is. We’re making history here, Frank. You’re going to appear in journals all over three galaxies. You’re going to be a celebrity.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh, don’t think that’s a plus for him, Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is not.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well, I’ll keep it all between us for the time being and I won’t share any data until you say so. Fair enough?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Fair enough.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no rulebook for this, Frank. But, look around, there’s no rule book for any of this bullshit.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The two of you are acting like I just found out I’m color blind or something, this is a little bigger than that.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t have much to offer you, other than what I’ve said, Frank. Verge is right, there’ no rule book for this, but we do know that all of this hootenanny is related to an encounter with Midnight Burger.</p>
<p class="dialogue">We don’t know a lot about Midnight Burger, but it did take up residency in The Triad recently and stirred up all sorts of trouble, so we know more now than we did before. Wherever that thing goes, very strange things happen. You’re one of them. But we’ve yet to see it have a negative effect on anyone it encounters. Pay attention to yourself, take it slow, and we’ll know more every day.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But, Frank. You need to tell June.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, speaking of glee that will make you uncomfortable, I do think it’s time to tell June.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... yeah, I know. Where is she right now?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is... hm.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">One moment...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">June can’t be located.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not getting a signal from her phone.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did she forget to charge her phone again?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fun fact: even when your phone is off I can track you.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She just disappeared?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well. No...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank this is going to upset you but I have said before that your phones are very insecure.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">This means... that I am constantly monitoring everyone in town and keeping detailed records on their whereabouts and... all of their conversations.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">In my defense, this is how Verge and I always operate, I need to be aware of our surroundings at all times.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not spying on people, Frank, Eldin’s only allowed to tell me things that effect my personal safety, everything else is in the vault.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s correct. Only when it’s a matter of life and death.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Or funny.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, there have been some funny bits I’ve shared. Did you know that Edgy Steve enjoys opera?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Eldin we are going to have a very broad conversation about this very soon, but can you tell me what’s going on with June, please?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">One moment. Let me compile a narrative from the data... Aha... well...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">June wanted to cheer up Deidre, so they decided to procure some alcohol and head over to Deidre’s house to come up with some design ideas for when she moves back in.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">This very quickly turned into the two of them becoming inebriated.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Expected.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And June unveiling a theory that she knows where the quote “secret military base” is.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And the two of them driving to it’s alleged location.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where they then disappeared.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Disappeared?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Disappeared... in an explainable way?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I believe so, yes.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is the explanation, Eldin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s obviously the secret military base.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There’s really a secret military base?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, “secret” is a strong word. None of you knew it was there, seriously? It’s right there, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never seen anything that suggests a secret military base. I grew up here, Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s giving off all sorts of frequencies, you never heard any strange sounds on your radio?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I thought they were just radio sounds.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">They are radio sounds, Frank. Radio sounds from the secret military base.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamnit. And what, they’re being held there now?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would imagine so. Their phones have most likely been put in some sort of frequency blocking container.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How the hell have they been hiding a military base in town?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not in town, technically. About three kilometers around the mountain.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are they doing there?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I could tell you but I’d have to hack into their mainframe. That sort of thing requires permission.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I give you permission.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not from you.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do it.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">One moment. Hello military firewall. Goodbye military firewall, and... Aha. It’s not categorized as a base, but rather a listening station. This nation’s government has them placed in strategic places all over the country, in quote “areas of interest.”</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do they do to intruders?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid intruders are at the mercy of the United States Military.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that entails?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It depends entirely on what they have and haven’t witnessed there at the station. If they’ve witnessed top secret operations, something is enacted called “Operation: Quick Wash.” Would you like a description?</p>
<p class="direction">VERGE HOLSTERS THEIR PISTOL AND PUTS ON THEIR JACKET.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope. Frank, stay here. Let’s go, Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are you going?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stay here!</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR CLOSES.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In Frank’s phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, Frank. I’m in your phone again. It’s still terrible in here, would you mind if I made some changes to your firmware?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I would mind.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO TRINKETT’S SHOP. TRINKETT IS ASLEEP AND WAKES UP WITH A START. AFTER SHE CATCHES HER BREATH, SHE GETS OUT OF BED AND PICKS UP THE PHONE. SHE DIALS AND GETS VOICEMAIL.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Frank, call me when you get this. Is anything going on? I just had the strangest dream. Call me.</p>
<p class="direction">SHE HANGS UP.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s going to love that.</p>
<p class="direction">TRINKETT WALKS OUTSIDE. THE TOWN IS QUIET.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What are you telling me?</p>
<p class="direction">AFTER A MOMENT, DOUG COMES AROUND THE CORNER.</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, hey Doug.</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you doing out here?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m not sure. I had a very strange dream. What are you doing out here?</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just closed up shop.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Anything going on?</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not really. Been a quiet night, it’s been nice. Oh, Haisly Jay came by and bought a bunch of deer repellent. She just said, “I’ve got them on the run.” Whatever that means.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... I think I need to go to the Glade of Wishes.</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Do you need a ride?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I think I need to walk.</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Would you come with me?</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, sure.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY START WALKING. WE MOVE TO AN EMPTY ROOM IN THE SECRET MILITARY BASE. DEIDRE IS PACING AND JUNE, A LITTLE DRUNK, IS SITTING AT A TABLE.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t believe I let you talk me into this.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, Deidre, I’m feeling pretty triumphant right now.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re prisoners, June.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of the secret military base that nobody believed was here. Huge win for us.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t believe you were right about this.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right, Deidre. Like most visionaries, they called me insane. But look at me now!</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly. Look at you now. A prisoner.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They can lock me up, but they can’t lock up the TRUTH, Deidre.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">June, I think your plan to cheer me up has failed.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nonsense, you’re having a great time.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what we need? We just need a couple of drinky-poos to get us nice and centered. Hey!</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where’s the beverage service in here?! What kind of establishment are you running exactly?!</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I really thought I was going to have a day where nothing fucked up happened.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know Deidre, but be honest. If nothing fucked up happened, wouldn’t you be just a little bit bored?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tiny bit?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just a little bit?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">June.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre, this is going to be great. They’re going to ask us some questions and then let us go. We jumped over a fence, big deal. Damn, I wish Celeste was here to see this. She was the only other one who believed in the military base.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>

<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who no one has seen for weeks.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who also thought there was a secret military base.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh my God.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They have Celeste!</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s been gone for weeks, how long are they going to hold us here!?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not leaving here without Celeste, you bastards!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Who are you, what’s your deal?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Listen here, Deborah. You’re the one who’s in a lot of trouble. You can’t just operate a secret military base without telling anybody.</p>
<p class="character">PRIVATE KENNEDY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not telling anybody is the key factor in operating a secret military base.</p>

<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, that’s his full name.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">T.J. is Theo Alex Dean Johansson Peppercorns?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You knew that.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No I didn’t. If I had known that I would’ve been laughing for my entire life. How did it end up being T.J.?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess because T.A.D.J. Peppercorns sounds funny.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Well God forbid somebody have a funny name around here.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please just tell her your name.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She already knows my name. She took our IDs, remember?</p>
<p class="character">PRIVATE KENNEDY</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m checking for known aliases.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you have to ask, it’s not a known alias is it, Debbie?</p>
<p class="character">PRIVATE KENNEDY</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ladies... this is your one opportunity to convince us you’re not here for nefarious purposes. I suggest you take advantage of it.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re very sorry.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not sorry—she doesn’t speak for me. Deidre, c’mon, we’ve got to play hard ball with these people.</p>
<p class="character">PRIVATE KENNEDY</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have literally zero bargaining power right now. You were both caught trying to break into a military facility.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I swear that’s not what we were trying to do.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s right, we weren’t trying. We succeeded, Debbie! We broke into your little treehouse—just a couple of broads on a bender, how does that feel?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh God, I give up.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where’s Celeste, Debbie?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not holding Celeste.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah? Why is that, because you already transferred her to Guantanamo Bay?!</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Private, can you please tell us what we can do to fix this? We really didn’t mean any harm.</p>

My parents were always on the road with the fair and the only thing close to a classroom for me was Sesame Street. They had a tiny portable television and at 8am every morning I would look around for PBS and there it was: School. That was the dream. It was just me watching sesame street. But it was crystal clear. I can still see it in my head. Dreams fade but it’s still with me right now... I don’t know what to make of it.</p>

<p class="character">STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huge moment for Snuffleupagus lore in that episode.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Steve. Snuffleupagus lore?</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, he’s right.</p>
<p class="character">STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Check it out. Snuffleupagus is lonely on Sesame Street, right? He’s wondering where all the other Snuffleupaguses are... Snuffleupagi? Which is it?</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, if Snuffleupagus is a greek root word then it would be Snuffleupaguses-</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guys.</p>
<p class="character">STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever. Snuffleupagus is lonely and he hears that there’s more Snuffleupaguses in Hawaii, so he goes to look for them.</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, and he looks and looks the entire episode, but he never finds them.</p>
<p class="character">STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But he doesn’t sweat it too much because, in the end, he’s got his family down on Sesame Street, even though none of them think he exists.</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, we should remember this is a “pre-reveal” episode, so everyone still thought that Snuffleupagus was Big Bird’s imaginary friend.</p>
<p class="character">STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So there we are, at the end of the episode. Snuffleupagus laments, “Oh well, I guess I’ll never find any more of my people.” He walks away, but the camera stays. In those last moments we focus on the volcanic mountain behind him, and we clearly see the mountain behind him is in the exact form of a giant Snuffleupagus the size of a mountain. Like a sleeping giant... what will happen when he awakens one day?</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s a potentially active volcano but it’s been dormant for a few hundred years. Any eruption would be proceeded by years of earthquake swarms and it’s been quiet out there for a long time.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever. Thanks for giving us back Deidre and June.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I kind of had to, Frank. Apparently you’ve employed a hacker and some sort of Ninja.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, about that. There’s been a clown car of nonsense rolling through town constantly, Celeste. Your bosses haven’t said anything to you about it?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I can’t say.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>

<p class="dialogue">What is... going on right now?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shh.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s ancient Chinese, which makes it a bit tricky because of the flexible word functions. Also, whoever carved the characters into this stone was not exactly a craftsman. Essentially, it is a message from a man named Xu Fu.</p>
<p class="character">STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who the hell is that?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">If it’s the same Xu Fu from historical documents, he was a legendary explorer. His emperor deeply feared death and sent him on a quest to find an elixir of immortality whose ingredients could only be found at the top of a legendary mountain named Penglai. This tablet is a message to his emperor. “I will finally return from the mountain, though I have changed as much as the land around me. The mountain will be found again, the mountain will be lost again. Forever.”</p>
