<p class="direction">THE FINAL MORNING IN HOOD’S POCKET.</p>
<p class="direction">VERGE AND DEIDRE ARE IN BED. DEIDRE IS STILL ASLEEP.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anything yet?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s chatter that it’s about to break, but I’ve heard that before.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s the holdup?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Teds are actively trying to stop the story from breaking. They’ve been successful so far, I’ll let you know when I hear something.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why doesn’t the universe want to give me nice things, Eldin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Verge, would you like to have a conversation about your neuro-chemical environment in the past month?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Point taken.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Waking up.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you two talking about?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">My neuro-chemistry.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what you two talk about in the morning?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m also waiting for some news.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What kind of news?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know yet, I’m still waiting.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big day.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big day.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I should get up, I need to get to the Sheep’s Eye for the big meeting.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... But I don’t want to.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t want you to.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You think Frank’s made coffee?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. How about I go check?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Can you simultaneously go get me some coffee and stay in bed with me?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid not.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s unfortunate... None of this feels real yet.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wish we knew more. Eldin, do you know anything more?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m afraid not, Deidre. The Teds have a tight control over the data, and the Teds can’t be trusted, which means I only have data from your planet to rely on, and that data is a bit byzantine. We know the impact is tonight. We have no way of knowing where yet.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Make me a deal?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s not think about it until after you’ve had a cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a good deal. I’ll take it...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your face in the morning...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about it?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Nothing. Go get me coffee.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here I go.</p>
<p class="direction">VERGE WALKS OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT AND DOWN TO THE OFFICE. THEY OPEN THE DOOR AND FRANK IS LISTENING TO THE NEWS.</p>
<p class="character">RADIO REPORTER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good morning, this is Chris Janda reporting live from the Global Crisis Center in Geneva. In what scientists are calling an unprecedented astronomical event, humanity stands united yet uncertain as we count down the final hours before impact. The Wayfaring Stranger – a name that has become synonymous with both dread and determination – continues its inexorable journey toward Earth. World leaders have gathered in emergency sessions, while citizens from Tokyo to Toronto hunker down in designated shelters. The question on everyone's minds isn't if our world will change, but how profoundly.</p>
<p class="dialogue">With just hours remaining before the first fragment enters our atmosphere, this reporter can only marvel at the extraordinary sight of nations setting aside their differences to face what may be humanity's greatest challenge.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Frank?</p>
<p class="character">RADIO REPORTER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stay tuned to this station for continuous coverage of this historic event.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thinking.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh... Frank, I could swear you’re looking at three huge bars of gold right now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Why?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Doug won’t shut up about financial systems collapsing and if they do, these three bad boys could be very useful.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not sure how I make that work for us, though. It’s not like I can take one of these into Fred Meyer and ask for change.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where the hell did they come from?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Clementine.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">She gave you three bars of gold?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She made them out of thin air.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think she’s coming back for them so I’m calling them an asset.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re very pretty.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">But what do I do with them?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Gold is fairly easy to manipulate, Frank. Do you know anyone with metallurgy skills?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually. Yes I do... That’s funny.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">One of the first things June said was to melt it all down and make it into something. I told her she was crazy... What if June has been right about everything this whole time?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a disturbing thought, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She knew about the military base... Would my life be easier if I just listen to June all the time?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s impossible.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is, right?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, if I may, discerning how to melt down three bars of gold seems more like a tomorrow problem than a today problem.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. I hear you. I think I’m trying to distract myself.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know how you feel, I’m in here on a coffee run for Deidre.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I think we can call that a today problem. I just made some over there.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is, of course, a coffee machine in every room.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t see how that’s relevant.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin, do we know anything else?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not yet.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">When are we going to?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">All I have to rely on is the data from Earth, but as soon as the Wayfaring Stranger is within range of the native sensors on the Phoenix, I’ll be able to give you much more detailed information. When that happens, I’ll let you know.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I want to stress again that the chances of a direct strike here in town are very small. The real concern will be the global ramifications of a strike happening elsewhere.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. Is June still out in the woods?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is she coming back for the meeting?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ll check with her.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t bother her, Frank. It’s the end of the world, she’s trying to have some fun. We all are.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I know.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What about you? The world’s going to hell and you’re still sitting here in the office.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Verge I’ve got a fresh pot of coffee and three bars of gold, what more could a man need?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a fair point, Frank. (As the door closes.) But you’re not a man.</p>
<p class="direction">VERGE WALKS TOWARD THEIR ROOM.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s happening, the news is breaking.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit.</p>
<p class="direction">VERGE RUSHES BACK INTO THEIR ROOM.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here we go, here we go.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The news I was waiting for.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin, where is it breaking?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Coalition portal, but it should make it’s way out to the rest of the Triad.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who broke the story?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who do you think?</p>
<p class="character">ALIEN NEWS ANCHOR</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the Tangle.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There is now outrage across the coalition planets as the news was broken regarding The Ted Empire’s manipulation of data on a celestial body now threatening Earth. The news was initially broken by controversial Sigian journalist Bertiluna Restiana broadcasting on The Undersignal...</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the Tangle.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, every once and a while you get to report on a story that you don’t have to put any spin on, you don’t need to spice it up with some fun language, you don’t have to dumb it down so that everybody gets it.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s our girl.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s that?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I get to just stand here and say what happened, and that’s enough. Weird, right?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s blue.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, here we go... The Ted Empire has allowed Earth to get raked across the coals by a passing comet in an effort to distract from non-stop rebellions and protests across The Triad. They’ve deactivated the impact security perimeter around the planet and falsified reports saying that the comet currently approaching the planet is harmless. We are about to watch Earth, a planet beloved by the entire Triad, go through hell due to a completely preventable celestial event. It is disgusting and it is emblematic of this empire’s insidious ruthlessness. They will attempt to deny this, but I have the data from an anonymous source, and it is embedded in the broadcast. See for yourself.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s us, we’re the anonymous source.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now, some of you will say, “Hey BertBert, if this is so important, why aren’t you going through official channels? Why are you broadcasting on The Undersignal?” Well, I’ll tell you why. I am currently broadcasting on The Undersignal for one reason and one reason alone— so that I can say the following... Get fucked, Ted Empire.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hoo baby.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is BertBert broadcasting on The Undersignal. Welcome to the fucking Triad.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Holy shit, Berts!</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who was that?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is the biggest thorn in the side of the Ted Empire, and one of the few people I’ve ever called my friend.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So- I’m sorry, I’m still trying to wrap my head around this- what just happened?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a small victory but I’ll take it. The ones to blame for Earth’s impending doom are called the Teds.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. “Teds bad.” I remember that.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And we just broke the story that all of this is their fault. Now we wait to see how much trouble this makes for them.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. And that’s good?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s great!</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, when you talk about all the space stuff, I still have no idea what we’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. Sorry about that.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Allow me, Deidre. Railroad monopolists of the 19th century.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m listening.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">They were a small group of men who controlled all of the transportation in your country. And they used this power to extract inordinate amounts of capital from the general populace.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the Ted Empire. They control all high-speed transit in three galaxies and use that power to put the screws to literally everyone.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Well, that sucks. Okay, I get that. And then, who was just talking?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s BertBert. She’s from a planet called Sigius. The closest equivalent to Sigius would be... did you have a class president in high school?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. Giovanni Salinas, he was a huge nerd.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Imagine an entire planet of class presidents.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, sure. I’m getting it now.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who would I be in high school?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know if we can carry the metaphor out that far-</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no, I know who you’d be.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’d be the one who smokes out behind the gym and listens to music I’ve never heard of... and you think about them a lot, but... you’re too much of a chicken to talk to them.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But here you are.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here I am.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre, I hate to break this up, but you asked me to remind you about the meeting at The Sheep’s Eye.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... Big Day.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big Day.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So, that blue person is a friend of yours?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She is.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...do you think maybe you could stay with her?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big Day, Verge... This planet’s not going to be a great place to live after today, I think if you need to go-</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought we were done talking about this-</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">-I don’t like worrying about you and if you have a friend out there-</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are you trying to get rid of me?</p>
<p class="direction">DEIDRE THROWS A PILLOW AT VERGE.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Don’t throw a fucking pillow at me.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t you suggest for one second that me wanting you to be safe has anything to do with me not wanting to be with you!</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... This has been the greatest month of my life.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me, too.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What would you do? To keep me safe?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anything.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me too, dummy. That’s all I’m doing.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I’ll say what I said to you last time. My ship seats two...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I can’t leave, Verge... I can’t be the person who leaves.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Then I can’t either.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me step in here. We still don’t know the level of destruction we’re going to experience. I should have much more information in a few hours. Let’s make decisions based on things we know and not on things that could happen.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You should probably get a move on, June. Big Day, big meeting.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, yeah, I’ll be there.</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">A great meeting back at the village?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s just going to be a bunch of the friggin’ townsfolk freaking out about a bunch of shit they can’t control. Kind of a waste of time, if you ask me... Maybe I’ll skip it. What do you think? Want to spend the last day on Earth teaching me how to make a saddle?</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... June... since you’ve returned to me I have been filled with elation. But I have approached you as one would a mythic creature in the forest: slowly, so as not to frighten you away. But I feel now I must speak.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Baby, the speaking is my least favorite part, though.</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You should go.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I should?</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I want nothing more than for you to stay and sit with me as we watch the sky fall together. But I believe now is the time for you to be with your people.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But can’t I just stay here and have you bring me things?</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I recall your ancestor. Aunt Hilda.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aunt Hilda, what about Aunt Hilda?</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was a fine woman. I constructed for her, a loom. And in return she provided me with a meal of lamb shanks and mint jelly the color of emeralds.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She did make a good lamb.</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You confided in me, in your most private moments, that you feared you would one day become like Hilda.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did?</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You said unto me, “I don’t want to end up the weird old lady up the mountain.”</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow, I did say that, didn’t I?</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And despite this fear, it is on the mountain that you remain. And though you remain here, you still do not see yourself as a denizen of the mountain. You wish to see yourself as apart from it. As though you fear that it will seal your fate to swear fealty to this place. But I believe that time has come, June.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tavi, the world is ending. What difference does it make if I go to a meeting or not?</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">When we first parted, my world came to an end. I believe you will be struck to find that, after the eve of the apocalypse, the sun cometh in the morn.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay, fine... Thanks for letting me hide out in the woods for a while.</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wherever I raise a roof, you shall always find a home ‘neath it. Your home is here. Your home is in my heart. And in your absence I shall burn for you in the night.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, Tavi. The things you say to me are so hot and so terrifying at the same time. And then I ask myself, “are they hot because they’re terrifying?” And then then answer comes back “yes,” and then I do a whole thing in my head... Okay, here I go!</p>

<p class="character">VERGE</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>

<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Space Foot?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I got a gas mask from Celeste and I went into Cameron’s house and I... I got to work. I dried out the mushrooms, turned them into a powder and I managed to turn the powder into what I think is a stable infusion.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett. You literally made a magic potion.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I don’t know what I made. I don’t have a basis of comparison for this particular mushroom so...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>

<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">How can I help?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can look at things right? Does he have eyes?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’d like me to scan your mushroom juice.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d be happy to. I do need to warn you, though. Transforming the Space Foot, an extraterrestrial fungus, into a usable medicinal substance is a very complicated process that’s never been achieved without superior technology.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I understand. Have a look.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very well.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So, Big Day.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big Day.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wanted you to know that I’ve been working really hard to get a sense of your aura.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s very complicated.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me about it.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think the problem at first was with your chakras. I was assuming you had the same energistic centers as a human, but you’re another being all together, so I had to really start from scratch.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what any of that means.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anyway, you’ve been giving off a lot of very positive energy these past few weeks. Are you and Deidre making love consistently?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... uhh-</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">None of my business. I’m just saying, whatever you’re doing, it’s working for you.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know Trinkett, this is actually not bad at all.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I have no idea how but in theory, this would be a usable agent.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s fantastic.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s highly unusual that Space Foot could be processed like this.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You think it might be helpful?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I don’t want to go that far. If you don’t mind I’d like to set up several testing regimens but we don’t have the necessary equipment so we’ll have to improvise. If all goes according to plan, we could have a a very powerful medicine in about a year or so.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">A year?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe two.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two years?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t want to rush things like this, this is a very powerful compound.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We might need this very soon, though.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I understand, but without all the proper testing infrastructure we’re going to need to take our time to do this responsibly.</p>

<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">One drop? And she just drank?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Welllllll, no one has ever ingested this much Space Foot in history so we’re in new territory here.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I’m sure it’s going to be fine. I’ve ingested some very strange things in my time, okay? Jimsonweed? That was a long forty-eight hours.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Sure.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me more about this stuff, what did I just drink?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">...ever?</p>

<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you. Okay, everyone. Big Day. Thank you for taking the time out to be here, I know all of us are really nervous, but let’s count our blessings. The news about the comet broke about two weeks ago for the whole world— but it broke for Hood’s Pocket about a month ago, so we got a head start on everything. Doug, you’ve been amazing getting everything organized, can you give us an update?</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, everyone. We’ve been working like crazy to get the old church converted over to storage and I have been stocking it like crazy for a month now.</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve got dry goods, canned goods, and medical supplies that should last us for quite a while. Now, the question that’s been hanging over all of us has been a very tricky one. If we’re talking about a worst case scenario, who gets what? This is a small town and it always has been. I’ve been here my whole life and for whatever reason this town just does not want to get any bigger or any smaller— but that doesn’t mean we’re all in the same situation. We’ve got people who have retired here up on Pine Ridge, all the way down to the colorful folks on trailer park lane. Lots of people took all sorts of winding paths to end up here. Everybody’s valid here, not because they made a bunch of money or because they work real hard, you’re valid because you exist. That’s all. Which is why we’ve decided that none of the goods that we’ve been stockpiling in the church are going to be available for purchase.</p>
<p class="direction">THERE’S SOME UNREST IN THE CROWD.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, everybody calm the fuck down... It’s called the... what is it called, Doug?</p>
<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">The tragedy of the commons. People get scared and they act out of self-interest and end up depleting public resources. We’ve got a big stack of empty milk crates outside. Everybody in town gets a crate and you can fill it up once a week with whatever you need from the old church. And look, this isn’t a new idea. Lots of us here do some hunting and some fishing every year, and every season we get our tags from the state that tell us how much we can take home. There’s a reason for that, it’s not a conspiracy. If we want to maintain our resources, we have to do it in a way that is, I’ll be honest, a little frustrating... you don’t find yourself living in a small town on the side of a mountain because you particularly like being told what to do. But the fact of the matter is, we’re all in this together.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And look, if you’re irked by this, I get it. I really do. Some of you may have remarked that I’m not the most agreeable person on the planet.</p>
<p class="direction">SOME LAUGHTER IN THE CROWD.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Shocking, I know. But, believe it or not, over the course of this year I’ve come to find that one’s desire for solitude will always be overcome by... by the idea that no worthwhile endeavor was ever created in solitude. It’s always been us. Making something together. So, with that said-</p>
<p class="character">STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, I’d like to say a few things.</p>

<p class="dialogue">... Sure, Steve. Sure, go ahead.</p>

<p class="character">STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you, Frank. Now, as we all know, you don’t need a guy like me anymore to partake in a bit of herbal supplementation. However in the past few weeks y’all have remarked that supplies have begun to dwindle. Lots of nervous folks out there right now and they’re all stocking up. So I took it upon myself to engage and old supplier of mine, K. Narcotics. A supplier that, shall we say, is not officially licensed by the state.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Steve, I’m sorry, your drug supplier is named K. Narcotics?</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Wayfaring Stranger is now within range of the sensors onboard The Phoenix. As you can see from the mockup on your phone, the situation has gotten very complicated. The main body of The Wayfaring Stranger will continue past Earth but as it passes, Earth’s gravity will tear off a sizeable chunk and pull it into Earth’s gravity well. That fragment of the wayfaring stranger will then begin to break apart as it approaches. There will be several strikes on Earth. Those strikes will travel in a line up the Pacific Coast of North and South America. The first strike will be Antarctica, there will be minimal casualties for that one, but the heat generated will cause all sorts of changes to the environment and increased glacial runoff is not exactly what your planet needs right now. The second strike will be off the coast of Lima, Peru. It wont be a direct strike, but Lima will be in the blast radius and there will also be massive tsunamis all along the coast for hundreds of miles. Much the same will be Monterey, California, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, they’re going to miss us?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. But the real concern of ours is this: accompanying those four major strikes will be literally thousands of smaller strikes from Antarctica all the way to Canada. Smaller pieces of the Wayfaring Stranger will rain down everywhere. These fragments wont be able to create tsunamis or melt glaciers, but they will be able to lay waste to farmland, burn forests, and destroy buildings.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And those aren’t going to miss us.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a statistical impossibility that they would.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, fuck.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We should get everyone to the base, we can shelter there.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not a terrible idea, Sergeant Major, but your base doesn’t have any underground structures and the building won’t provide that much more cover. Also, the time it would take to organize that amount of people getting all the way around the mountain would definitely leave people out in the open and right now it’s best that everyone be inside a structure of some kind... The only thing you can do right now is inform the town, and hope for the best.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guess it’s okay that I skipped the meeting, then.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right now I’m linking all of your phones to me. Should the cellular network go down we’ll still be able to communicate through the network I’m creating. Verge, if you don’t mind, I think you should leave me with Trinkett for the time being.</p>

<p class="character">DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was confused about it at first as well, but upon further research it makes a strange kind of sense. The Mungo is a curious creature. They appear to be native to a few planets on record, which shouldn’t happen. It’s fairly impossible for the same species to develop identically on planets thousands of lightyears apart. But then it was discovered that the Mungo emits a faint signature of tachyonic particles, suggesting that their relationship with space and time is perhaps a bit more casual than yours and mine.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It was an accident.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bullshit.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it’s true Frank. Trinkett has accidentally ingested a large amount of alien fungus.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? She thought it was a bran muffin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, no, she ingested them on purpose, it’s the hallucination that’s the accident.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, you ate alien mushrooms and didn’t think it was going to make you hallucinate?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mistakes were made. I’ll be the first to admit it, but I think I’m really onto something here.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever. Eldin, please make sure Trinkett is inside when hellfire starts raining from the sky.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Will do.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin, do you hear something?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course I don’t hear something, I’m not hallucinating.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">People are coming.</p>
<p class="direction">THE FOOTSTEPS THROUGH THE WOODS COME TO AN HALT.</p>

<p class="direction">TRINKETT MOVES THROUGH THE WOODS.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>

<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Like the soldiers from the army base?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No no, they’re wearing armor. They’re all Asian, they have bows and arrows and swords.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting. Try describing their armor.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay it... it looks like a bunch of squares sewn together.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That would be lamellar armor, making them probably Chinese about 2nd century BCE.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wait, I can still see the mountain in the background. I’m still on Mt. Hood.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re seeing 2nd century BCE Chinese Soldiers on Mt. Hood?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you’re basing this hallucination on the tablet that was found in the glade of wishes, the one with the Chinese writing on it. Xu Fu was the man who allegedly wrote it, he was from that time period.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay but why am I seeing this?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re seeing this because you’re hallucinating, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello?... They can’t see me.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">They can’t see you because they’re not really there. You’re hallucinating.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re all looking at something... It’s... they all stopped in front of something. They’re all looking at some sort of structure, some sort of metallic structure. It’s very big... Eldin, where am I standing right now?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re standing in the town square.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what am I facing?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re facing the Sheep’s Eye.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay... I think I’m in the past, on Mt Hood.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That doesn’t make any sense at all, but then again you are hallucinating.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>

<p class="dialogue">Any idea how we’re going to pull her out of this?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not like she’s gone very far, she’s just standing in the town square like an idiot. If things get dangerous, someone come scoop her up.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Fine.</p>
<p class="character">STEVE</p>

<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, Trinkett. It’s very busy on my side of the mountain, but your little magical mystery tour has been a wonderful distraction.</p>

<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There is a particular signal that comes from this area. It’s a very strange signal, we don’t know the origin, and it’s our job to monitor it. That’s all.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Kinda boring.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, that’s my job.</p>
<p class="direction">WE BEGIN TO HEAR A SINGLE PERSON COMING THROUGH THE WOODS.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, shh. Someone’s coming.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is she afraid her hallucinations are going to hear us?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, this is a different guy. White guy. He looks like he’s from the pioneer days. He’s got one of those old rifles and a horn with gunpowder in it... wait I recognize him... Deidre, are you there?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That painting above the fireplace in the Sheep’s Eye, who is that a painting of?</p>

<p class="dialogue">That is Macon Peppercorns, he’s the founder of Hood’s Pocket.</p>

<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I think we know where this hallucination is coming from.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, the structure is still there. He’s looking at the structure too. Right where the Sheep’s Eye is supposed to be.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me more about this structure you keep seeing.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s kind of hard to tell, it’s overgrown by trees now. It’s shiny and metallic. I don’t see any rust on it. It’s a couple of stories tall, I think... Deidre, tell me more about this guy.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um, I don’t know much about Macon Peppercorns. He was a pretty mysterious guy.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was the founder of Hood’s Pocket?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, but he used to say this weird thing to my grandpa. Apparently he used to say “Teddy, I didn’t found Hood’s Pocket... I found it.” Whatever that means.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin, tell me again what that tablet said. The one we found in the glade of wishes.</p>

They were brilliant and beautiful, maybe a little arrogant... But I had to be this. Carry a gun around, fight for my life, travel light, no attachments... The unnatural became second nature... It’s the most unnatural thing in the world, loneliness... But I adapted. I survived... Vapus Vella... “Vapus Lives.” If I live, then, somehow, my people still live. That’s been the rule... Is this living? Is this being alive? It’s more than just breathing in and out... It has to be... What a fucking tragedy if living is just breathing in and out... I can’t do this anymore... Staying alive is fucking killing me.</p>
