<p class="direction">WE BEGIN AT TRINKETT’S SHOP. WIND BLOWS THROUGH WINDCHIMES AS TRINKETT’S BARE FEET WALK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. SHE LIGHTS INCENSE AND SITS ON THE FLOOR. SHE BREATHES IN AND OUT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SPEAKS.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">As the Earth holds me. As the Sky sees me. As the Sun rises within me. I step out to greet the Day.</p>
<p class="direction">SHE CONTINUES TO BREATHE UNTIL THERE IS A TIMID KNOCK ON HER DOOR. SHE TAKES ONE MORE BREATH AND ANSWERS.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come in.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR OPENS AND DOUG WALKS IN.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello Doug, come in.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, am I disturbing you?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not at all, Doug, come in.</p>
<p class="direction">DOUG SHUTS THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just okay?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m good... I’m sorry, that’s a lie, I’m just okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you remember the emotional intelligence wheel I gave you?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Right. I’m uh... fragile. I’m feeling fragile.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And because you used the word fragile, you feel less fragile, right?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Yes, a little.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good. Sit down.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="direction">DOUG SITS ON THE FLOOR. TRINKETT BREATHES.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry I’ve been away for so long. Have you been able to drink the skullcap tea in the morning?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Yes, I have, it helps a lot. I gave up coffee.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s great. I mean, there’s nothing wrong with coffee, it’s just very powerful and you need to pace yourself.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve had a little coffee.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s okay.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Things have been very strange in town.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, Doug, they really have, I’m glad you came to see me.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not really sure what to do with it all.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, the first thing to do is, what you’re doing right now, reach out to other people. Try and stay connected.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what do you say to yourself?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">“I’m not sick.”</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not. That’s right. The stars have made you sensitive to things that others aren’t. Things affect you differently than other people. That doesn’t mean you’re wrong, that doesn’t mean you’re broken, it just means you’re different. Different is good. Different is important.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right... It would help if things weren’t getting so strange. I mean, it’s nuts out there, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know it is, Doug. It’s not just you, it’s hard for me too. It’s been very hard to stay centered and connected for me, too. It’s not just you.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are things with your Dad?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, he’s still an asshole.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">But he also can’t take care of himself, so I’m over there a lot.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. Well, we’ve talked about this before, your father spent most of his life working for timber companies. Bringing down old growth like that releases a huge amount of energy that was being contained in the trees. He spent far too many years being exposed to that, he’s carrying a lot.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">He tends to make that my fault, though.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, Doug. That’s not an excuse, that’s an explanation. He really is an asshole.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t spend more time over there than you have to.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I won’t.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... what do you need today? Is the tea enough do you think? I’ve got some linden oil that might help.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... actually something’s going on, it could be nothing, but I thought, y’know, considering everything that’s happening...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s about Cameron.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cameron, what about Cameron?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">He... you know how he has his Wall Street Journal delivered to my store?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Thank you for doing that, by the way.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s no problem. It’s easy. The paper gets delivered to the shop and I drop it off at his front gate every day. He pays me way too much money to do it.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what is the problem, then?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">The papers have been piling up a little. He hasn’t been picking them up. I dropped one off this morning and there’s five newspapers at his gate now.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure it’s nothing. Considering what’s going on lately, though, I thought I should say something and I know you go up to see him sometimes so I thought... Maybe I should come see you.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... thank you for doing that. I’m glad you told me.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure it’s nothing.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure. But I’m glad you told me.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Should I tell Frank?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, don’t worry about it. I’ll check on him, you don’t have to worry about it.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">In fact I’ll do that right now.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY BOTH GET UP. TRINKETT OPENS A BOX ON THE COUNTER.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Before you go, I want you to take this. Keep this with you. It’s sodalite, it’ll help you stay cool out there, okay? Just keep it in your pocket, don’t leave home without it.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay great. I’m so glad you’re back.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me too, Doug. I’ll let you know when more skullcap comes in, okay.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="direction">DOUG EXITS.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What’s going on, Cameron?</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE HORIZON MOTEL. JUNE IS OUTSIDE DRINKING COFFEE. A CHICKEN APPROACHES.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah... You again...</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK WALKS OUT OF THE OFFICE.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that sound?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Estelle’s back.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You named Clementine’s chicken Estelle?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did. Good morning, Estelle.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did you name it Estelle?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look at her. It works right?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It does.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Estelle.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How has one lone chicken been surviving in a forest full of chicken-eating things?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooooh, I do not want to know the answer to that question.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nor do I.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe Estelle’s a survivor. When Trinkett’s comet swings by and obliterates the Earth, Estelle’s still going to be here. Just Estelle and cockroaches and Nick Nolte.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see we’ve added “getting obliterated by a comet” to our daily parlance.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see we’ve added “daily parlance” to our daily parlance. Are you a Dickensian banker?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not going to be obliterated by a comet.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett says there’s a comet heading for Earth and it’s going to obliterate us.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not what she said, she did not say obliterate.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s just like you to quibble over terminology when the world is on the brink of destruction. Can you believe this, Estelle?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t drag Estelle into this.</p>
<p class="direction">VERGE EMERGES FROM THEIR ROOM LIGHTING A CIGARETTE.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Morning, Verge.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Morning.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s up this morning?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh you know, just taking it all in before we’re obliterated.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">See?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought it was my job to be the pessimistic one. I don’t like you two moving in on my territory.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody elected you the President of Pessimism, it was a volunteer position that you always took on pro-bono.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’ve resigned my position and now I’m switching sides since you two seem to have it covered.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well look at you. Look at the growth.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m just saying, just because there’s a lot of weird shit going on doesn’t mean that every hair-brained theory is correct.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like I don’t even know you.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a chicken, right?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Verge, this is Estelle. Say hello, Estelle.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You eat these, right?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not eating that one.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no, we are not. Stay away from this chicken, Verge. It’s cursed. Bad Juju.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey, speaking of witches and curses.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s this?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>

<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s Cameron.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cameron?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I talked to Doug, Cameron hasn’t been picking up his newspapers.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, maybe he just realized he was the last person in America to get the newspaper delivered.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think he may have regressed while I was gone. We need to check on him.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you need us for?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I tried ringing his intercom several times, he’s not answering.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What can we do about it?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re breaking in.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh, we are, are we?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not going to break in to Cameron’s high-tech compound, I wouldn’t even know how to do that.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would you just get your tools and come with me?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe he’s just out of town, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s an agoraphobe.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit. Really?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was working with him before I left... I shouldn’t have left... He didn’t trust doctors so he would call me once a week. We set up a plan where he would, once a day, leave his house to go pick up the paper at his front gate. It wasn’t a lot but it was working for him. Now there’s a pile of Wall Street Journals at his front gate.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, Cameron’s gate is solid steel, the locks are all computerized, he’s got security cameras, he could have machine gun turrets for all I know. My bolt cutters aren’t going to do the trick.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve got to do something.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Talking only to Verge.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, space friend.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are they talking about?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cameron Winterborne-Welsh. Local reclusive billionaire. Do the rich people get really weird and eccentric where you come from?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Totally.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This guy’s like that. He invented a couple of things and made a bunch of money and then one day he buys a big plot of land up here, builds a high tech compound and then we never see him.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’re going to break into his house?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I was wondering-</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh boy.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was wondering if your magic pocket pal had the ability to hack into a high tech computer lock situation.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m assuming, yes.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please don’t talk about me like I’m not here.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Eldin. Do you have some sort of Asimov’s law that prevents you from doing crimes?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">June, look who my owner is. This is the longest Verge has gone without committing a crime.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s cool. You guys are so cool.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d recommend against this but what a waste of processing power that would be.</p>

<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The estate has its own operating system. Not bad for Earth, actually, but something’s corrupting the system. Connections are being made where there shouldn’t be.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is there a workaround?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Thank you. I can take it from here.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... No. No, I’m not, would you come with me?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Lead the way.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY MAKE THEIR WAY ON FOOT UP TO THE ESTATE.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So he’s an agoraphobe, huh?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not about open spaces for him, it’s about purity. Feeling clean. The house is completely sealed off from the outside world and he’s got a complicated filtration system that everything runs through. He said he began to feel like every time he was outside, something was trying to infest his body. He didn’t want to feel that way, it was just an inescapable feeling for him.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apparently when you work with microchips you have to do it in a clean room without any dust particles. You have to wear this head-to-toe suit that keeps you from corrupting things. He said the first time he ever stepped into one of those clean rooms was the most calm he’d ever felt in his life. He got obsessed with the feeling. It took over everything.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And he turned to you for this? I didn’t think there was a magic spell for Agoraphobia.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very funny.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is there a magical spell for Agoraphobia?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, are you honestly asking me about my work or are you just looking for an opportunity to make fun of me?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can’t it be both?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re such an asshole... I’d start with passion flower tea. Then if that didn’t work, Black Tourmaline.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">A rock?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wear it as a necklace near your sternum.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did any of that work?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He never tried it. He was just as skeptical of me as he was a conventional doctor. He just felt like he could talk to me. I accepted him for who he was, without any judgement. That can be very powerful for someone.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There it is.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck, it’s huge.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, not exactly a cozy, blanket-on-the-legs cabin in the woods is it? I guess if I lived there I’d get a little agoraphobia too.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Eldin, define Agoraphobia.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I got this one, Eldin. It’s a fear of going outside.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Agoraphobia is a rare human condition wherein a person develops an irrational fear of locations that appear to have no easy escape. Because of this fear they may have the tendency to avoid leaving their homes. Based on what we’ve heard, a more accurate assessment of this man may be mysophobia, an irrational fear of germs and contamination.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But Trinkett said he was an agoraphobe.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are no experts on this subject in our immediate vicinity.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sounds like airlock shock.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are some similarities between mysophobia and airlock shock.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sometimes if you’re on a long haul, you spend a lot of time with recycled air and sealed airlocks. If you spend enough time in the black you can get attached to the idea that you’re in control of your entire environment. Then, the next time you need to dock somewhere, you hesitate. You don’t want to leave the safety of your perfectly manicured air supply. You begin to fear what’s out there.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow. Did that ever happen to you?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Once. I was in some pretty deep trouble so I had to make my way into some uncharted territory. I was in a sealed environment for how long?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Approximately two Earth years.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It took you two years to get where you were going?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two years. No stops along the way.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus. How big was the ship?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was very, very small... I remember reaching out to depressurize the docking port for the first time. My hand shook. It took me a while to get up the courage to leave. I’m sure space travel seems pretty romantic to you, June, but it’s definitely not a place to make your home.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How long have you made it your home?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>

<p class="dialogue">What?</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m going in there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, listen to what Verge just said. There’s a very high chance of there being a dead body in there.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not afraid of that. I’ll put a mask on.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, Trinkett, I’ve been through this when I used to work demolition, okay? It’s not just a mask you need.</p>
<p class="dialogue">For mold spores it needs to be a full-face gas mask AND with something called a P100 filter. Nobody in town has those.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why not?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’s a town of 600 people, Trinkett.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’s not that kind of spaceship.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell kind of spaceship doesn’t require a spacesuit?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Verge’s ship is a converted racing sloop. It has no airlock therefore no spacesuit is required.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>

<p class="direction">LATER. WE CAN HEAR THE SOUNDS OF DRINKING AND LAUGHING INSIDE THE SHEEP’S EYE. THE DOOR OPENS.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That was a very nice service you performed in there.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks... I wish I could’ve done more...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure we all do...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I was in the high desert with five other practitioners once... One of us was going through a very scary time and we decided we would try and invoke a spirit for courage... The Great Horned God is what we call him... Not that horned god, a different one, okay?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We sat around a fire as the sun set. After an hour... I swear to you we saw him... He was standing in the fire. I could see the flames curling around his legs... it was transformative... We were all really deeply changed by that moment... And I remember thinking to myself that that would be it for me. That will be the strangest thing I ever experience. Some curved flames in a campfire... After today... After today I... I think today broke me. I don’t know how to bring meaning to what I do anymore, I can’t explain what just happened... It broke me.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... There’s a saying where I come from... “May you be blessed by the world breaking you. May you survive the blessing and break the world.”</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I get a very strange energy off of you.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you... Here.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is... You took one of the mushrooms?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">...I don’t know what this is.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s got a stupid name. It’s called the Space Foot.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it looks like a little foot and because it can survive in the void of space... Space Foot.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why did you take this?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it’s important. If you can figure out how to process it, that little fungus can obliterate any disease it comes into contact with. It’s one of the rarest things in existence.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know that?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I used to smuggle them... I thought it might help you to know that your friends body isn’t lying in a tomb right now... It’s laying in a fucking pharmacy.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Who are you?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You realize you’re not ready to ask me that question yet, right?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes... Yes I do... It’s a beautiful little thing, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Tell everyone I said thank you.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey Doug. Come in... How are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... I actually came in to see how you were doing.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh... That’s kind of you.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m so sorry about Cameron.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I didn’t really know him.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>

<p class="direction">TRINKETT ...</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did he have any family?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, it was just him.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">... The whole place had really been taken over by mushrooms?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yes... How have you been feeling about that? I imagine it’s a little worrying for you.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s funny I...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">It effected you.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It really did, yes.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Is it weird that that helped me?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’ve been hit by two snow plows, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I know, Doug.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I live in a small town at the top of a very big mountain to avoid things like that happening and it happened to me twice.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It did.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">So there’s no getting away from it. That’s what I said to myself. It’s all inescapable so I better just worry about everything all the time.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you did.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I did. All the time. So there I would sit, either worrying about the things I did or worrying about the things that could happen, never on the present moment, like you always tell me to do, and it sucks real bad, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I watch people walk around all day and they’re fine. They don’t think about everything all the time like I do, their minds are free and clear and... it’s just today for them... I really hate them for that sometimes... Why can’t I be like that? Why can’t it just be today for me... And then I saw you at Cameron’s wake and I saw you were upset and... I don’t know... you helped me by being upset... just by being human... And I just thought that maybe, with you being here and us always coming to you with problems, maybe you feel like you always have to be... better. Above it all... and maybe that’s a little exhausting.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It really is sometimes.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a lot going on right now, Trinkett. It’s okay to be freaked out like the rest of us... in fact maybe we’d appreciate it. Maybe it would help us.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you do saying that.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need to open the store. You should come by the Sheep’s Eye sometime. We’d all love to see you. Even Frank.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok... I’ll think about it.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright. Have good day, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You too, Doug.</p>
