<p class="direction">MORNING. WE HEAR THE SOUND OF NAILS BEING HAMMERED INTO WOOD. VERGE APPROACHES. THE HAMMERING STOPS.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’re you feeling?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m feeling alright.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK GOES BACK TO HAMMERING.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you feeling?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I’ve got a truck full of scrap wood and I’m boarding up Deidre’s windows, how do you think I’m feeling?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Can I help?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you know how to board up a window?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, you don’t. Apparently, hidden somewhere in all these trees is a space ship, that you can fly to a distant planet but you don’t know how to board up a window. Ironies abound.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Apologies aren’t subject to the transitive property, Verge. Apologizing to me doesn’t mean you’ve apologized to the person you need to apologize to.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think she wants to talk to me.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That actually doesn’t matter when you need to apologize to someone.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t mean she’s mad at me, I mean she’s scared of me.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That actually doesn’t matter either.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think your folksy Earthling wisdom applies to this situation, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes it does, Verge. Do you know why? Because it’s my fucking town. We didn’t start playing by your rules when you got here, you play by ours.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I came to tell you that I’m leaving. I came to tell you that I’m sorry and I’m leaving. You won’t have to worry about your town or your rules anymore because I won’t be here. Alright? One less thing you have to worry about.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, you’re not leaving.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes I am.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m trying to make this easy, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Easy? Easy. There was a fucking laser gun shootout and you and Deidre were almost killed, you’re trying to make it easy?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know what I mean.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well here’s what I mean: If you decide to fuck off now and head for Tatooine or whatever, what was your last known position?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was right here, Verge. And that means that more of your space friends are going to show up here looking for you and that’s going to be a problem for us. This means that you are going to have to stick around and deal with this problem yourself. That’s what a good person would do.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I haven’t exactly been truthful since I’ve been here, but at no point did I try and convince you that I was a good person.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then I guess you can do whatever the fuck you want then, can’t you?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve never been able to do what I want.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that grants you nothing, Verge. Your life being rough does not entitle you to make it rough for others. It grants you nothing... I’m telling you what a good person would do. The rest is up to you. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to finish boarding up these windows so that Deidre can actually live in her home.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK GOES BACK TO HAMMERING. VERGE WALKS AWAY. WE MOVE TO THE SHEEP’S EYE.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, how long are you going to be doing this for?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you have a problem with my bartending, Steve?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I was just wondering.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have a problem with my bartending.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I-</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">After all I’ve done for you, you’re going to criticize my bartending, you ungrateful little twerp.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m saying, I think you’re good at it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, you’ve got a real knack for it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m making the drinks too strong, is what this is telling me.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think they’re just perfect.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Speaking of which, what are you doing day drinking? We need everybody bringing their A game right now and you’re over there on your second Tequila Sunrise.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">June, everybody in town is day drinking these days. And by the way, I asked for a Tequila Sunrise and you brought me a Bay Breeze.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not taking notes at this time.</p>
<p class="direction">DOUG CARRIES A KEG OF BEER BEHIND THE BAR.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’ve got a keg of Full Sail here.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you, Doug. Look at Doug helping.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m helping, I’m contributing to the local economy.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You just asked me if you could pay for your drinks with Dogecoin.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a valid currency.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is neither valid nor currency.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, guys... Has anyone seen Celeste recently?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Celeste.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Celeste.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Shit.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">She hasn’t been to the store in a while.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great... That’s just fucking great.</p>
<p class="direction">DEIDRE ENTERS.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, June. I’m here. Sorry, I can’t seem to get used to sleeping somewhere else, I really appreciate you doing this for me. Can you do me a favor though? I need to go to the hardware store. Frank made me a list of things I need to order so he can fix everything—I need to just run across the street and give them this list. Oh, also, can you please help me find a way to pay Frank for everything he’s doing? I’m going to offer to pay him and I’m sure he’s going to say “Don’t worry about it.” And then I will proceed to feel guilty for the rest of my life... Goddamn, that house was built in 1923 it just breaks my heart... Why is everyone looking at me?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre...</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You just did this.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You just...</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">You were in here five minutes ago and you just said the exact same thing.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, y’all I know I’m usually going nine different ways but I think I’d remember if I’d already come in here this morning.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ, are we all high again?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t feel high.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do, but I mean... I am.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can déjà vu happen as a group?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought déjà vu was just the feeling that something happened again.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I mean we were all right here when Deidre walked in, you said everything exactly the same way you said it just now.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did... did I forget everything I just did?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Happens to me all the time.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not comforting.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre, maybe try and retrace your steps.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s not trying to find her keys, Doug.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I had a very superstitious german grandmother. Her number one fear: the doppelgänger.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s your spirit double. It’s a harbinger of doom and destruction!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh God.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh God!</p>

<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Okay, good. Doug coming in as the rare voice of reason. Let’s hear it, Doug.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do we know for sure? We know that Deidre is standing right here with us. We also know that Deidre just called June on the phone. But that’s all we know. June. What did Deidre say?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Which one?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">The one on the phone.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She said that they had to make a few calls at the hardware store to make sure she could get all the things she needed. That she was going to need a few minutes.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. And then?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then she’d be back.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’d be back—she can’t come back—what if something bad happens when she meets her doppelgänger?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Steve if you say doppelgänger one more time-</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, wait... We need to get eyes on her.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">She was just in here.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if it was, I don’t know, some kind of time thing. We need to absolutely confirm that there’s a Deidre in here and a Deidre across the street.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh, Frank gave me a list of things I need to rehab my house.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see... And how long have you been here?</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um, about ten minutes, I guess. That house is so old I have to make sure I get wood that matches. I don’t actually think it’s a big deal but Frank says it’ll start to look weird over time if I don’t use the right wood.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, we don’t want things to look weird.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>

<p class="direction">FRANK PICKS UP THE BOTTLE.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It’ll be fine. I’ll head over to the Horizon and we’ll have a nice casual chat. “Hey Verge, how are you feeling, how are your laser gun injuries, also do you happen to clone people after you bang them?” Super-casual.</p>

<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi. Did you clone Deidre?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you make a clone of Deidre?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There are two Deidres in town. There’s a Deidre at the Sheep’s Eye and a Deidre at the hardware store. Done any cloning lately?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t clone people.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, let me really think about it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are there two Deidres in town?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where’s Mr. Smartypants? Eldin!</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please, Mr. Smartypants was my father.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin how could there be two Deidres in town? Has she been cloned?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Unlikely.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How unlikely?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cloning is possible. Your planet has even done it. The men that attacked her house were clones.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh fuck, really?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but cloning is not an overnight process. For Deidre to be sampled and cloned would take several Earth months at least just to get an embryo.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, then what’s the deal, Eldin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Tell me exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was bartending at the Sheep’s Eye, Deidre walked in and said she needed a few more minutes before she started and listed off all the things she has to do today. Then, a few minutes later, she came in again and said the exact same thing. Now there’s two of them.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds like you have a temporal anomaly on your hands.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, how did that happen?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s extremely rare, but it’s possible. Imagine the universe is encased in a giant cube of Jello. If you press on any side of the Jello cube the fabric of time within the cube can bend and loop and cross over. Events may repeat themselves, elongate, or skip forward. It happens.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are we supposed to do about it?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s nothing to be done. These things usually work themselves out.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. So we just sit here?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is important to stay away from the anomaly.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The more you interact with an anomaly, the more the chance of it solidifying and becoming a permanent fixture.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I only talked to her the one time.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">June. You don’t know which one of them is the anomaly. Did you stay away from both of them?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, shit.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh. Where are the Deidres now?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">One’s at the Sheep’s Eye and one’s at the hardware store.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s early yet, but I’d say we’re well on our way to there being two permanent Deidres in town.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds bad.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure everyone would get used to it eventually.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I don’t think so, Eldin. What else have you got for me?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, it’s theoretical but you could try merging them.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get them in the same room and hope for the best.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds really ill-advised, Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have access to the knowledge of three galaxies, June. What do you have, other than your encyclopedic knowledge of Farscape?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, you don’t have to be a dick about it.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you can get them in the same room and have them focused on the same thing, get them of the same mind, get their thoughts and intentions aligned, you may be able to merge the anomaly with the original without having to sacrifice either.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. I love Deidre, I really do... Focused, though?</p>

<p class="dialogue">The smudge sticks and the magic rocks and the flowing garments, yes. They all look a little goofy to me, but the only problem I ever had with you and your whole thing was that... I think I have a problem with anyone who says with authority “I know this for sure.”... I guess I have a problem with that amount of confidence.

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, I get up in the morning and I feel things. There’s a certainty to those feelings that I can only call belief. And my journey through life isn’t about trying to figure out what to believe, it’s about taking in the world that’s presented to me and finding a way to fit all that into these feelings of certainty.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Probably true.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel it. In my bones. As certain as I feel the ground. But the important step is: does this certainty hurt me? Does it hurt someone else? That’s when I know I’m onto something. My belief isn’t shaken by all these things that are happening in town. It’s a struggle to understand what they all mean, sure. But they do mean something... to me at least. But still... fucking aliens?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hello ladies...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What are you doing here?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m... I’m here to apologize.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think that’s the most important thing right now.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know it doesn’t seem that way, but June’s not letting the two of you out of here until this problem is solved so I’m afraid you have to hear this wether you like it or not.</p>

<p class="dialogue">I don’t feel great about you being here, Verge.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. Eldin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Greeting, Deidres. You are currently the victims of a fairly nasty temporal anomaly. From what I can gather time looped back on itself when Deidre entered the bar for the first time this morning and when the second Deidre interacted with the people in the Sheep’s Eye there was a deviation and now we have two Deidres.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m... not the real Deidre.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me be clear. You both are.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How is that possible?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would we like a lecture on relativistic verses quantum mechanics or do we want to just take my word for it on this one?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do we stop it?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It may seem a bit odd but... Verge is going to say a few things.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that have to do with-</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry... Obviously I didn’t know that was going to happen the other night but considering the list of people who would like to see me dead, I should’ve taken better care with who I spend my time with... I... I couldn’t get you out of my head and it sort of took over... I convinced myself that I was in the clear. That things were different...</p>
<p class="dialogue">I convinced myself that I was one of you. Just a happy person on a planet somewhere.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Verge, I’m terrified of you.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was hiding under the bed like you told me to... I heard everything, I heard the person that you became when they showed up.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re a dangerous person.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That scares me.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m scared to be in this room with you right now.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you understand that?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... I apologize for everything that happened but I’m sorry, I can’t apologize for that person you saw. That’s the person I’ve had to be... I was this kid in a refugee camp once. That’s all I used to be. Over the years, it’s like I put this whole other person on, bit by bit, like pieces of armor. I think it’s what anyone would’ve done.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Verge, there’s this part of me that wants to hear this, and wants to understand what happened.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And there’s this other part of me that’s scared to hear more. I don’t want to hear things that will make me even more afraid of you.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. It’s not time for me to tell you my life story.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I appreciate your apology, Verge, but...</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a lie.</p>

<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t have that.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know... Look... you won’t have to worry about it for long. Frank thinks I should stay for some reason but I’m not staying. I’ll be far away soon, I just need a few more days to plan and then I can get out of here-</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, that’s not what I want.</p>

<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Verge, no. I...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have nine thousand feelings about this whole situation.</p>
<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I don’t like the idea of you out there all by yourself, that doesn’t feel right to me.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That scares me even more.</p>

<p class="character">2ND DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">-is it right for me, then, to put you in danger?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>

<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a controlled zone. There’s a process to go through, a bit like one of your national preserves.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, well that sounds safer to me than...</p>

I think that’s what I... you were in my head too... you are... but there’s a lot more that comes with that now and I don’t know how to feel about all of it... I’m scared of you but I don’t think you’re a monster... you’re a person... despite all that, what I need from you right now is for you to be safe.</p>
