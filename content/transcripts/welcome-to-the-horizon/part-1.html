<p class="direction">WE HEAR SOUND OF THE SHEEP’S EYE ROADHOUSE. PEOPLE ARE CONTINUALLY FILING IN AS FRANK AND JUNE SIT AT THE BAR.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So that was fun.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kinda been looking for a category to put that whole experience in.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me too.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">All night. I’ve been doing that all night.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t sleep either?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sleep? Ha! Sure. Sleep.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s like... Everybody has weird shit happen to them, right? They swear they saw a ghost or a UFO or Sasquatch.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that’s easy to understand.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. I know what a UFO is or Bigfoot but this...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hard to describe.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Gather round the campfire, everyone, and let me tell you of the time an entire diner appeared in our parking lot.”</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And how right before that, several copies of my mom and dad started arguing in said parking lot.”</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And how some leggy redhead showed up and apparently started unravelling reality.”</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And how it was all solved by the... I don’t know... the universe being rebooted or something.”</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“And before all that, Frank was disintegrated and then put back together again by that same redhead.”</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, too soon?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, you two. What can I get you?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidra.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re back.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I’m back.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought you joined the Peace Corp or something.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">You did? Why?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I asked TJ where his granddaughter went and he said “She joined the Peace Corp or something.”</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. No, I was doing some community organizing in the city.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What were you doing?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was the “Stop the Tram” project?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a tram? What tram are you stopping?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Mt. Hood Tram?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Am I supposed to know about this?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know anything about this.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">They want to build an arial tram that takes people all the way to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you stopped it?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Trying to stay positive.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope. They’re totally building it. We totally failed. Months and months of getting the word out and we totally failed. And then I fell into a deep “what the hell am I doing with my life” depression, so I figured I should probably come work for my grandpaw again. So, I am now back, completely humiliated, serving drinks to locals.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sucks, Deidra, I’m sorry. How’re you holding up?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still super depressed, successfully covering it all up by being chipper.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Atta girl.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Deidra, let me ask you something, have you noticed anything weird lately?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does being a grown-ass woman without any direction in life count?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s say no.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then, no.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you notice anything out of the ordinary, could you give me a call? You have my number, right?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure. That’s kind of a weird thing to say, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is kind of a weird thing to say, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just give me a call, okay?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. What can I get you?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two IPAs?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You heard what they said last night. Things could get weird here, we should keep a lookout.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was last night.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know I just figured, Clementine was here a few times, maybe... I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re going to start a neighborhood watch for strangeness?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Frank, are you maybe a little freaked out right now?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aren’t you?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... I think I’m still in shock.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me know when that wears off.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that scientist lady didn’t tell me that I got... I forget her exact words.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She said, “At one point she disintegrated your body... and then she reconstructed your body from ambient molecules in the atmosphere.”</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... that’s not great.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But look... look I’m poking you right now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can see that.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s solid Frank, right there. You’re right there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Am I?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">If my truck was destroyed and then someone made a new truck out of thin air that looks like my truck, is that my truck?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, did you check the glove compartment for that road flare you keep in there?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m being serious.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I know Frank, but you brought up some serious philosophical shit just now, I don’t know if we’re going to get that worked out in an afternoon at the Sheep’s Eye Roadhouse.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Guess not.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re Frank. You’re right there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Frank?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Flat Doug.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I asked people to stop calling me Flat Doug.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry. Doug. Hi.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I heard you were asking around about weird shit?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You... How did you hear about that already?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was like ninety seconds ago.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I heard it, okay?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you seeing some weird shit, Doug?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay. What are we talking about then, Doug?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just want to be warned if there’s anything weird going on.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like weird shit, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We understand.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been hit by two snow plows, I don’t like weird shit. It’s a pattern with me.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We get it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Technically, getting hit by three snow plows would be a pattern. Twice is just a coincidence.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would you even put that out into the world, June?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now I’m freaked out about a third snow plow.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You weren’t before? I would be.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">She’s really sorry.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s currently Spring, so, you’ve got that working for you.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We didn’t mean renegade snow plows, we were just talking about... just, if you see anything out of the ordinary give me a call at the Motel, okay?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">You guys have got to tell me if something’s going on.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We will, Doug, I promise. Give me a call?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, okay.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look both ways when you cross the street... I mean, seriously though, who doesn’t hear a snow plow coming? And then doesn’t hear a snow plow coming the second time?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have to protect Flat Doug. No one else is going to work at the convenience store, it takes a particular brand of human to do that.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The “plow magnet” brand, apparently.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Celeste. Hello.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I heard you were looking for weird shit?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">See what you did?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was... Sure, Celeste, what have you got?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, the raccoons were back at my place again.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Celeste, you’ve really got to fix your garbage cans okay?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There were two of them. I heard them back there, they knocked over my trash cans, so I rush out back to shoo them away, and when I hit them with the porch lights, one of them he...</p>
<p class="dialogue">instead of running away he just stood up. Like a man. And he stood there with his arms wide, like this... He just stood there like he wanted a hug or something. He stood there like that for five minutes...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You stood there, staring down a raccoon for five minutes?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well what was I supposed to do?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Discuss current events?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think that’s the kind of weird thing we we’re talking about, Celeste, but you really need some locking trash cans.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why am I going to spend money on something I put garbage in?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We just replaced ours at the motel, I’ll bring a couple of our old ones by your place, okay?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, okay... Standing there like a man.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I understand.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I would say she needs to quit drinking but I think I’m more scared of a sober Celeste. Oh shit, Edgy Steve alert.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, how’re you doing, pal?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Steve.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Listen, I’m hearing rumblings in town about weird shit going on.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does this happen in two minutes?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’d like to get the inside track on this. I need to know what’s going on at all times. I don’t want any surprises.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s nothing to tell, Steve. It’s just a question I asked Deidre literally two minutes ago.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need to stay abreast of these things, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Abreast?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A guy like me? I’m an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re a meth dealer.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And as an entrepreneur I need to have my finger on the pulse of the community. I need to be jacked into the nervous system, I need to stay on top of trends.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">In a town of six hundred people?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have a lot of projects coming down the pipeline, if there’s weird shit going on, I need to know about it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are these projects, Steve?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I can’t talk about it, it’s proprietary.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does proprietary mean?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Proprietary means I can’t talk about it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not what proprietary means.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I promise I’ll keep you updated, Steve.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks, man. Hey, are you on Linkedin?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please go away now.</p>
<p class="direction">DEIDRE PUTS TWO PINTS OF BEER ON THE BAR.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Two IPAs.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Frank, my grandpaw just called, he wants to know why you’re asking around about weird things going on.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your-... Where is your grandfather right now?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fishing.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did... Does he have security cameras up in this place or something?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRA</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, I don’t know, maybe?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. (Addressing the entire bar.) Everybody-can you cut the music for a second Deidra-Everybody listen up. Everybody... Look, I know I just asked Deidra literally a few minutes ago if she’s seen anything weird lately. That doesn’t mean it’s time for people to panic–it was an innocent question it’s not anything to worry about.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you hear about Celeste’s raccoons?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Standing up like a man.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not what I’m talking about at all. Raccoons do weird things, we’ve all seen it, that’s not what I’m talking about.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you talking about, though?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you going to help me here?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what happens when you don’t discuss things with me beforehand.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, we all live here, okay? If there’s something you’re not telling us, I feel like we have a right to know what it is.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if it involves snow plows.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It doesn’t involve snow plows.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this about the secret military base?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no secret military base.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, the very nature of a secret military base is that you don’t know about it.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Their transmissions break into my radio station sometimes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, they don’t.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m with Celeste, I think they’ve got one of those listening stations hidden around the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what it is, a listening station.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? Can either of you tell me what a listening station is?</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s where they listen to things.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, you can’t. You can’t say it’s nearby if you don’t know what it is.</p>
<p class="character">CELESTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Agree to disagree.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, you can’t start asking about weird shit going on without telling us why.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Never mind. Okay? Forget I said anything. I’m not asking about anything, I’m not curious, I’m not suspicious. I’m nothing. Okay? I’m Frank. I’m sitting here at the bar having a beer. That’s it. No weird shit is going on. Everything’s fine. Everything’s normal.</p>
