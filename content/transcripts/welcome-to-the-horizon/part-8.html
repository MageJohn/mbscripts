<p class="direction">MORNING AT THE HORIZON. FRANK EXITS THE OFFICE AND WALKS OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT SIPPING COFFEE. IT IS A TIME OF DAY WHEN HE THINKS EVERYONE ELSE IS ASLEEP. AFTER A MOMENT WE HEAR THE SOUND OF SOMETHING VERY FAR AWAY. IT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS THE CALL OF A VERY, VERY LARGE ANIMAL.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck...</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK’S PHONE RINGS.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you hear that?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... yeah I did.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Uh... what now?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hang on, I’m trying to convince myself it was an elk.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh-huh... it wasn’t an elk, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No... no, it wasn’t.</p>
<p class="direction">TRINKETT ...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Before we freak out about this, how about we consider it was just our imaginations and it was one of those shared hallucination things.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure okay.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="direction">TRINKETT ...</p>
<p class="direction">THEY HEAR THE FAR-AWAY CALL AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Okay... I’m voting no on our imaginations.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is it?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We have to go see.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wow, just the worst thing you could possibly say.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to pack a bag, how soon can you leave?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">How soon can you leave?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not going out there.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course we are.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, that was not the kind of sound you go towards, that’s a run away sound.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, time is of the essence so let me cut to the chase here. Whatever we just heard we don’t want someone else in town to find it, right? Also, I’m definitely going to go see and I know you’re not going to let me go alone.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, we can go round and round for five minutes, will that make you feel better?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m bringing my Winchester and there’s nothing you can do to stop me.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t approve but whatever gets you in your truck.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Fine.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO THE INTERIOR OF FRANK’S TRUCK DRIVING UP A MOUNTAIN ROAD.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you think we could get up to Barrett Spur by nightfall?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was thinking if we could get above the treeline maybe we could see something from there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did you bring your binoculars?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Are you hungry? I brought some trail bars that I made.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ooh, I do not want to know what’s in those.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s sorghum, cacao nibs and molasses, Frank, it’s not a magical potion.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anything else?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s some green algae in there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Ginseng.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">If I keep asking are the ingredients going to get weirder?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Probably.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I can’t believe we’re doing this.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">This was your idea.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, I still can’t believe we’re doing this.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We’re going to get up there and have a look and then we’re never going to hear anything again. That’s probably what’s going to happen.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I’d be fine with that.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good...</p>
<p class="direction">TRINKETT ...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Think it’s bigfoot?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I don’t think it’s bigfoot.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t believe in bigfoot?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You believe in a lot of things.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bigfoot isn’t one of the things.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Thank you for coming.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s still the slow season, June’ll be fine on her own.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Oh right, you run a motel.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nothing, it’s just weird to hear about normal things now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bigfoot would be a relief, honestly.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Thank God, it’s only bigfoot.”</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So there’s something I need to tell you.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... We’ve talked about this before but it’s kind of been getting lost in the noise so...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The comet.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Still heading for Earth?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Remember I told you I had that friend in South America who worked at an observatory?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s the one I was getting all my information from. Last I talked to him the Wayfairng Stranger was still headed for our neighborhood.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Joy.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">The good news is it’s looking like it’s not going to strike Earth directly.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">But there’s still a high chance of it passing very close by. Meaning it could shed a ton of debris on Earth.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fantastic.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">But there’s no real way to know.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, I hate to bring common sense into the conversation, but I feel like if a comet was heading for earth that it would be on the news or something.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a whole community of stargazers out there. My friend Joshua is in the minority on this particular issue.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How much of a minority?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I suppose you could call it a fringe theory.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So this could all add up to nothing?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, the thing I have to tell you is: I called him yesterday to get an update and a “Corporal Diaz” picked up the phone. He said that all communication with the observatory was to go through him now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Where is this again?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Chile.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So the Chilean military has seized control of an observatory.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Not the greatest sign.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">The military is not in the habit of seizing control of observatories, no.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Can we get some sort ball park estimate of what could and couldn’t happen here?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">The ball park is... in one scenario we just have a really stunning light show as debris burns up in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds good.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">The other scenario being several fragments of the comet the size of a small town crashing down, destroying a significant part of the earth and causing irreversible damage to the whole damn planet.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh-huh... So somewhere between those two?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Or nothing at all.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Though, the way things have been going...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">“I’m sure it’s nothing” doesn’t seem to be doing it lately.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="direction">TRINKETT ...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s go find bigfoot.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="direction">WE MOVE TO A TRAIL HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN. FRANK AND TRINKETT MAKE THEIR WAY ALONG A NARROW PATH.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Watch your step, it gets pretty narrow.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I haven’t been up here in years.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Park service is doing a pretty shitty job of maintaining these trails.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You come up here a lot, right?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Used to.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought you did this every year.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I did, but then I took over the Horizon and things got busy.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You should really get back to it, rituals like this are important, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know... Shit.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like there was a rock slide at some point, the trails completely covered.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we get past it?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I usually complain about stuff like this and it gets fixed.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well you haven’t been up here and you haven’t been complaining, I guess this is what happens.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t know if this is a good idea.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We can get past it. We’ll climb over the rocks and the trail keeps going, it should be fine.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re pretty high up, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not like I’ve never been up here, Frank. I’ll take it one step at a time, it’ll be fine. We should get a move on it’ll be dark soon.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Fine. I’ll go first to make sure there’s no surprises.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds great.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay...</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK BEGINS TO CLIMB OVER THE PILE OF ROCKS THAT ARE COVERING THE PATH.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take it slow.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m taking it slow. The rocks covering the path look pretty settled in, I think they’ve been here for a while... This is what happens to the world when I stop complaining, Trinkett. Everything goes straight to hell.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody understands how important you are to the world, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly... Okay, when I get to the other side I’m going to tie a rope to myself-</p>
<p class="direction">THE ROCKS BEGIN TO SLIP UNDER FRANK’S FEET AND THEY ALL BEGIN TO SLIDE AWAY.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck- SHIT!</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">FRANK!</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK SLIPS OFF THE EDGE AND OVER THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF, WITH SEVERAL SMALL ROCKS FOLLOWING AFTER HIM. FRANK IS GONE.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh fuck! Shit, Frank?!?! FRANK!</p>
<p class="direction">TRINKETT TAKES OFF RUNNING BACK DOWN THE TRAIL. FAR OFF SHE STILL CALLS TO FRANK.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Far off.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank!</p>
<p class="direction">AFTER A MOMENT WE MOVE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF. FAR OFF, TRINKETT COMES RUNNING DOWN THE PATH LOOKING FOR FRANK.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank?! Frank can you hear me?! Are you hurt?! Try and make any sound at all!!... Frank?!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m right here.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh FUCK!... Holy shit, Frank you scared the SHIT out of me goddamn! I couldn’t see where you... where you fell... Where you...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m fine.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You’re... you’re fine.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That’s... Frank that was a... four story fall.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You can’t be fine after that.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Let’s make camp.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A CAMPFIRE. FRANK TELLS HIS STORY.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I tried to write it off as nothing... but the evidence started to mount up... First it was Rambo... When Rambo came out of the woods, all two tons of him, it was like he couldn’t see me. When June came out of the office he started howling at her, he could see her, he could see Verge. I waved my arms trying to get his attention but it was like I wasn’t there... Then there was the mushrooms... then the ayahuasca...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Frank for anyone to survive that fall would be a miracle.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It was like jumping down from the branch of a tree.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Her name was what? Clementine?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And you’re saying all this is happening because of her?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... We thought the first weird thing that happened was Relentless Rick... it was me. I was the first weird thing to happen in town.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m going to go ahead and stick a pin in this Clementine person and whatever this diner is that you’re talking about and I’m just going to focus on you, okay?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">...What about smaller things? Are there little things you’ve noticed? Maybe not weird on their own but they add up?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... I stopped sleeping.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You-... Frank, that’s not a small thing.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Never really slept much to begin with so... I don’t know, I get tired at night like everybody else but then the sun comes up the next morning and I’m fine.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Have you told June about any of this?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">June knows but I haven’t told her about the mounting evidence. She’s been a little distracted.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Well, in retrospect you have seemed different lately.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Different lately? Of course I’ve seemed different lately, Trinkett. I died... The guy you went to middle school with is dead... I’m not him... I’m whatever was put in his place...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think that’s true, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, I don’t care about whatever Stevie Nicks song you’re going to sing me about my soul in the moonlight or whatever, my body was disintegrated and something else was put where my body used to be.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, I’m maybe the only person who can talk to you about what you’re going through right now, you want to shove it with the witch jokes for a minute?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Do you remember the time I convinced you to go to my parent’s Renaissance Faire?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You didn’t convince me to go.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, I didn’t, you were dating some girl back then. SHE thought it would be fun, so there you were in the middle of the Renaissance Faire... Do you remember my parents’ Renaissance Faire?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was a pretty crappy Renaissance Fair, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It wasn’t great.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Bard with the Tuba?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">There was a bard and she was playing the tuba, yes. But she was very enthusiastic and it was all she knew how to play.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kind of broke the illusion for me.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, there were also cash registers, so...</p>
<p class="character">FRAN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are you bringing this up?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because you were there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That wasn’t me.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve been talking a lot about your body, Frank. And thinking about it. And agonizing over it. This is more than I ever expected to talk about your body in my lifetime. I don’t know what this new thing is you’re inhabiting, but I’m here to tell you: your body, to me, and to those that care about you, is the least important part of you. It’s just a place that you live in for a while. It could be anything, honestly.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How do I figure out what I am?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, how does anybody?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s nothing in the self help section of the book store for this.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. You’ll have to write your own book.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t want to write my own book.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t mean literally write a book, but, side note, don’t get mad if I start taking notes around you... You should start by talking to people. But maybe talk to them before you plummet four stories off a cliff.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not telling Steve about this.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely do not talk to Steve about this... But you should talk to June.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I know you hate that because you don’t like to ask for things, but you have to, Frank. This is too big for you to be the lonely guy up the mountain.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not the lonely guy up the mountain.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kinda. You kinda are, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I like people.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You do. And it’s what you hate about yourself the most.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Thank you for being normal about this. Or abnormal, you’re not having the reaction I thought you would.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. I’ve been thinking lately... I think we’ve barely scratched the surface.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of what?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Something’s going on, Frank. All these things that are happening, it’s all headed toward something. It seems random but there’s a rhyme and reason to it, I don’t know what. That experience at Cameron’s house with the mushrooms, it really broke me. Then I took the ayahuasca to try and find a way forward and in a weird way it did, because there I suddenly was with Steve in the glade of wishes. Have you noticed Doug lately?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s like a different guy.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. I mean, the same.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, still a mess.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">But different. He’s really risen to the occasion. All these things are bringing us closer to ourselves and bringing us closer to each other. You and I could’ve never had this conversation a year ago.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Scratching the surface of what?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. But all of this is heading toward something. What’s going on with you right now is just part of that.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Wow.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was rough for you you.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Are you okay?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not really.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, here, let me give you something to make fun of so you’ll feel more comfortable.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that?</p>
<p class="direction">TRINKETT GETS UP AND GETS SOMETHING OUT OF HER BAG.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I do this whenever I sleep in the woods.</p>
<p class="direction">TRINKETT BEGINS SHAKING A BAG AND POURING A LINE OF SOMETHING AROUND THE ENTIRE CAMP SITE.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, what’s this about?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just a little security for the evening.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my god... wait... is that just a big bag of oats?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re pouring out a bag of oats right now.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh boy the explanation for this is going to be really something isn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Laugh all you want, this is what I do.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please tell me.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I pour a circle of oats around my campsite... because fae people cannot cross a line of oats.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fae people?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fairies?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you must.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’ve just fairy-proofed our campsite.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, Frank. Fae people are essential and beautiful creatures and they can also be total dicks. So you surround yourself with a circle of oats to protect you from their dickishness.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see. And how do we protect ourselves from the legion of mice that are about to attack our campsite?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m trusting the owls to take care of that problem.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I feel safer.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me too. Watch: fuck you, fairies! See, I wouldn’t do that if I wasn’t surrounded by oats right now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, be honest, are you doing this just to cheer me up right now?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but I’m glad it is.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, well now that you’ve protected our campsite from fairies with magical oats we can get a good night’s sleep before we go hunt a monster in the woods tomorrow. Because we live in Narnia now.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. I’d offer to keep first watch but apparently you’re not going to sleep, so it’s all you tonight. I hope you brought a book.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got a thrilling book on Japanese furniture joinery I’ve been meaning to get to.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh. But I’m the weird one.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good night.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually, give me the first few pages of that book, I bet it’ll put me right out.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK OPENS HIS BOOK AND READS.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">At its core, Japanese joinery is a testament to the profound respect for wood as a living material. Unlike Western methods that often rely on metal fasteners or adhesives, traditional Japanese joinery uses interlocking wooden joints to create furniture and structures that can stand the test of time. These joints are designed to accommodate the natural movement of wood, resulting in pieces that not only endure but often grow stronger with age.</p>
<p class="direction">WE FADE OUT ON FRANK READING TO TRINKETT. THE NEXT MORNING FRANK IS AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, LOOKING THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS. TRINKETT APPROACHES.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, how’d you sleep?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good, I always sleep great out here. What are you looking at?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Here, take the binoculars.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... I don’t see anything, you need new binoculars.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The binoculars are fine, it’s down over there. See that clearcutting patch?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a perfect square where the timber company cleared out the trees, now look just south of that.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Huh.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s another blank patch but it’s jagged as it goes through the trees.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Like something cleared a path through the woods.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you still eat food?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, now that we’ve had our little talk, please don’t treat me like a carnival freak.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Carnival freak? Frank, come on, I was just asking a question. Wouldn’t you be curious?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I still eat food.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Good to know... You know, I was thinking last night, I’m worried that you don’t sleep anymore.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel fine.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sleeping is when we commune with the astral plane, it’s really important for spiritual health, it’s why people lose their minds from sleep deprivation.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel fine.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">But then I thought, maybe in this new form you’re existing simultaneously in this plane and the astral plane.</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here’s an interesting question, if we find someone out here do we warn them?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Warn them?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. I mean, what if there’s something dangerous out here, shouldn’t we tell them?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">We warn them about something out here that may or may not be here, we don’t know what it looks like, and it could be our imagination?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, okay, I hear you.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Ready for what, Tavrok?</p>
<p class="character">TAVROK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come. If it’s the beast you seek, you won’t find it whilst wandering the deep. You may sup with me tonight and we shall wait until it passes by in the fading light.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah, it was pretty serious for a while but then he wanted her to move out here and raise chickens or something.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was the deal breaker?</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I’ve seen some tattoos.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. Tons of tattoos of The Green Man out there. He’s this mysterious spirit of the forest whose been wandering since the beginning of time... You know, a lot of people think that The Green Man is from medieval England. But actually you can see depictions of The Green Man from the 2nd century BCE in Iraq. You can see him in India, Nepal, Borneo. Nobody really knows where he came from... Maybe he doesn’t either... That big creature we just met, he’s wandering around in the forest not knowing where he is or why he’s there. You are too... But the thing is Frank: so am I. So is anybody... It’s all the same journey... yours just looks a little different.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So what am I supposed to do now?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You think it’s this thing you need to do... Just live, Frank... The journey will take care of itself.</p>
