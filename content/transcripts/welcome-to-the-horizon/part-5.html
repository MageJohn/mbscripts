<p class="direction">MORNING ONCE AGAIN AT THE SHEEP’S EYE.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, here’s something...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are we going to do during skiing season?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean, “what are we going to do?”</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean what are we going to do?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you be a little more specific than that?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Welcome to the Horizon Motel, please let us know if you need more pillows or of your toilet sprouts tentacles and tries to eat you.”</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah... Right.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, I’m usually a big fan of long term thinking but I don’t think I can see all the way to tourist season right now.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because of the comet that’s going to hit us and destroy the Earth?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">A comet is not going to hit the Earth, I wish you would stop saying that.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I wish you’d stop saying that.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not listening to what Trinkett told us.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">If anything, a comet is going to pass very close to Earth. It’s not going to hit us.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And when it passes?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">When it passes it will, quite possibly, shower the Earth with dangerous debris that could have cataclysmic consequences.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Listen to what optimism sounds like these days.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="direction">DEIDRE APPROACHES.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, you two.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Deidre.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are we doing?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank’s trying out optimism lately and it’s like he’s wearing a funny hat all the time.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Well, in keeping with that, I have a few things.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here we go.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let the games begin.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am also going to try and stay positive while delivering some stressful news.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, good luck.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s happening?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are experiencing a bit of a dip in the population.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">People are moving away.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">They are?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, a lot of rental properties are owned by T.J. and I handle a lot of the rent collection and deposits for him. A lot of vacancies are opening up so I started checking into it. Lots of people are leaving town.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, I don’t know the exact number but, Eli the Electrician is gone, Locksmith Andy is gone.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the only electrician and the only locksmith in town.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t lose your keys, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Basil is also gone.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Basil.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Y’know, Basil and their tea?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The tea shop.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Closed down and moved to Boring, apparently.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A tea shop in Boring. Get it?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what happened to Dr. Lattice, but there was a note on her door saying “Living with the raccoons now.”</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Raccoons?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have to say, I saw that coming.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was she a doctor of?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nobody knows.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also Zivia’s mom and Pepper’s mom.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pepper’s... who?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Embarrassingly, for some people, I only know their dog’s names.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aha.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How many all together?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again, I don’t know, but I’m guessing about a hundred.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can you blame them?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I guess not.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I think about getting out too but, I don’t know, I feel like I’d be abandoning people.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I get it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not everybody’s going to feel that way, Deidre.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, maybe they’re better off. I’m certainly not going to beg anyone to stay. If someone needs basic electrical work done just tell them to call me.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If they loose their keys tell them to go through the window.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if they need tea, tell them to drink coffee.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Speaking of which, I’ll come back with some coffee.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks, Deidre.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Deidre.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you for staying.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="direction">DEIDRE WALKS INSIDE.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly if I were her age I would’ve left when Relentless Rick showed up.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I think Deidre’s got a few more reasons to stay than your average Hood’s Pocket citizen.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? Because of T.J.?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I think Deidre’s got a little thing for our local extra-terrestrial.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre’s got a thing for Verge?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so. The vibe is out there. Can you feel the vibes?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I try not to feel vibes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re out there.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So Deidre, our nice local barkeep, has a thing for Verge, the apparently quite dangerous space alien living at our motel.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Correct.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... that’s not a train wreck waiting to happen at all, is it?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not at all.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had a prime opportunity to make an alien probe joke right there and I abstained, where is my Peabody Award?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">A grateful nation thanks you.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Somebody should be getting laid, right? This is the end of the world, shouldn’t people be sleeping with each other? Maybe I should call Tarvok.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you call Tarvok, I’m leaving town. Does he even have a phone? Don’t you have to blow a mystic horn from a mountaintop for him to appear?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, he’s got a horn alright.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Desist. Immediately.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey here’s something. It’s ten AM and nothing weird has happened yet.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Do you you know what you just did?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just jinxed it.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You just jinxed it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Somebody had to.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No they didn’t... You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to go talk to Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. I think she’s still a little messed up from our mushroom festival the other day, I’m going to go check in, make sure she’s alright.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Normally I’d object, but I think you’re kind of right.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Order me some oatmeal when Deidre comes back.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was that? Chocolate chip pancakes?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oatmeal.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whipped cream on top?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK MAKES HIS WAY ACROSS THE STREET TO TINKETT’S SHOP.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Morning, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Doug.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, I heard that Eli left.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, if you need some basic electrical I can probably do it.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, he got all his supplies through the store so if you need wires and stuff I can get them.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s great.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also Locksmith Andy?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">The guy who got me the change machine, he can also get me one of those automatic kiosks that makes keys for you.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Might take a couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s do that.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. I’ll let you know when it’s here.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you.</p>
<p class="direction">DOUG KEEPS WALKING.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK (CONT’D) Hey, Doug.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You seem more relaxed lately, are you doing yoga or something?</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... honestly I think everyone in town is now at my usual anxiety level, so it just looks like I’ve calmed down.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that sounds right.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">See you.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bye.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK STOPS AT THE DOOR.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, we’re going to be nice, we’re going to be supportive, we’re not going to make fun of anything... today. No promises tomorrow.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK WALKS IN TO TRINKETT’S SHOP.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK (CONT’D) Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m alright, how are you?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m good, I’m good. I was just talking to Deidre, apparently we’re seeing some people leaving town.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think we expected that.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, so I was thinking, maybe we should get a meeting together over at the Sheep’s Eye? People may want to leave, but won’t be able to, maybe we should try and assure people that they’ll be alright if they stay?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t think I can do that today.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, look. I know the experience at Cameron’s house was rough, but I think you might feel better if you engage with people a little bit, y’know? Get out of your head.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve just taken some Ayahuasca.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you know what that is?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course I know what that is.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, I think a town meeting would be bad.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve done this many times before, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, I’m sure, but you chose right now?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need some clarity.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Some clarity.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m losing focus and I’m losing vision. I need some guidance so I brewed some this morning and I just drank it. It’s going to be fine.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, what’s this going to do to you?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought you knew what it was.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know it’s what tech billionaires do at resorts. It’s where they get their great ideas on how to fuck up society.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a very pessimistic view and I can’t help that it’s being misused.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s it going to do to you?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to experience some visions and probably a bit of euphoria. What I see will be dictated by what I’m seeking.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Which is what?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I have a particular worldview. Things have begun to happen that are outside that worldview and I need to expand my vision. I need a better understanding of the world as is changes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right now, you need to do this?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So while I’m out there dealing with all of the basic services disappearing from town you’re just going to be in here tripping your nuts off and communing with the spirits?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Essentially, yes.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... You told me we were in this together, that the town was going to need both of us.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was serious about that.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You in here talking to the ghost of Timothy Leary while I’m out there dealing with things is not us “being in this together.”</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you want some tea as well? It might help me if we did this together.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m feeling very lost, Frank... I need to do this... This is what I do when I feel lost. Everybody knows what it means when you disappear up the mountain for a few days. It’s the same thing... please don’t be upset with me.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ... Well, okay. Enjoy. If you happen to find the key to your enlightenment, be sure not to lose it, because we don’t have a fucking locksmith anymore.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK WALKS OUT THE DOOR. DOUG COMES RUNNING DOWN THE STREET, FULL TILT.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit. Oh shit. Excuse me, Frank. Oh shit!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That didn’t last long.</p>
<p class="direction">FRANK STARTS WALKING BACK ACROSS THE STREET. A CAR DRIVES BY, AS IT PASSES HIM THE DRIVER YELLS OUT THE CAR WINDOW.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Life is an illusion!</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="direction">THE CAR CONTINUES DOWN THE STREET AND LIGHTLY CRASHES INTO A TELEPHONE POLE. THE HORN CONTINUOUSLY HONKS.</p>

<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Somebody just crashed into the telephone pole.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Ok.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>

<p class="dialogue">I think so.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre, it’s nine-thirty in the morning. Nobody in the history of the world has ordered a turkey sandwich at nine-thirty in the morning.</p>

<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre, I think those are ours.</p>

<p class="dialogue">So?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Verge. You have decided, at least for now, to make a home amongst people. That implies certain things. Things like helping them out in a jam and checking on them when they are mysteriously dosed by an Amazonian hallucinogen. Work with me here.</p>

<p class="direction">EDGY STEVE Yes.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... The Triple Goddess and the Great Horned God.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who are they?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">They are embodiments of the duality of life. That’s the best way to put it, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are they real?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Steve, I don’t know what’s real anymore.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t know, Steve. Maybe.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I think, maybe I shouldn’t have spent so much of my life making sure skiers had enough weed and meth, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Maybe?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It just kind of happened to me.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know the feeling.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you ever feel that way? Like your life just kind of happened to you?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had to make a lot of conscious decisions to be who I am, Steve. A lot went into the making of Trinkett Coralee, I wasn’t born like this... Then again, my parents travelled with a Renaissance Faire nine months out of the year, so I guess it’s not much of a surprise that their daughter wound up being a witch at the top of a mountain.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I heard you were a goth in middle school.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Yeah I was.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I bet you were pretty cool.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly, I was. Cheerleaders were scared of me, it was pretty fun... What were you in middle school?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I never showed up for middle school. So I guess I was that kid that parents told their kids not to hang out with, I guess that was me. Cautionary tale... Trinkett, what if the world comes to an end and that’s all I ever did? I thought I’d have more time than this.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Steve, I think if you’d spent your whole life being an ideal citizen, then right now you’d be saying “Damn, why didn’t I do more drugs?”</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Laughing.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s the duality of life I was talking about. Always wishing for the other thing. People who kept it simple worry they were too lazy, people who achieve a lot worry they never took the time to slow down. Kind of a no-win situation.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you happy with what you’ve done with your life?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">See... that’s the trap, Steve. “Am I happy with what I’ve done? With who I’ve become?” Implying you made mistakes along the path, that there was some right way or some wrong way... Those things are impossible to know. There’s a whole host of spirits out there. They can haunt your dreams and keep you awake at night, rattle the dishes in your cupboard... none of them are as terrifying as the ghost of the life we didn’t lead.</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... If those gods of yours were real, is that what they would say to be right now?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what they would say. But I know they put me in this glade with you right now. And I’m thankful for that... Have you eaten anything today?</p>
<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I forgot.</p>
