<p class="direction">WE ARE IN THE BACK ROOM OF A ROWDY BAR. OUTSIDE THE DOOR WE CAN HEAR THE MUSIC AND PEOPLE OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLANETS.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I knew this guy once, he had aspirations. “Sweets” Martinez. He wanted to be a brewmaster. This is a common problem in Oregon because, if you have a garage and a jug and the right paperwork: Poof, you have a brewery in the eyes of the state. More micro-breweries per capita than any other state. Anyway, his whole thing was Espresso Stout. And I don’t mean the usual espresso stout that tastes like coffee, he was talking about literally combining beer and coffee. “Imagine getting up in the morning and having your first beer and your first cup of coffee. How does that sound?” Well, it sounds like an Alcoholism fast pass, is what it sounds like, Sweets. He responded: “Alcoholism is for quitters!” Special guy... Anyway, one day we all look around and we realize we hadn’t seen Sweets for a few days. This is a guy who never misses a day at the bar, right? So we don’t think much of it but Deidre, dear sweet summer child, Deidre. She thinks we’ve got to go do a wellness check on him and I’m like “All of us already know he’s unwell so... check!” But she won’t let it go, so we all pile into her truck bed with roadies and we head over to his trailer... I have no idea what we’re walking into but, if I had a hazmat suit in that moment... you know what I mean? So we’re all standing there outside his trailer and all of us are a little bit buzzed at this point because, how else are you going to do something you don’t want to do?... Deidre’s tapping on his door, tap tap tap “Sweets? Sweets, we’re worried about you, are you okay in there?” tap tap tap. “Oh, enough already!” I say, and I kick the door open... you guys... not even H.P. Lovecraft could describe the smell that came out of that trailer. My eyes were watering, I think it literally stripped my nail polish off. And somehow, it was NOT the smell of Sweets being dead, it was the smell of success! Turns out Sweets had finally cracked the code of his espresso/beer combo and he drank so much of it that he proceeded to poop himself nearly to death for the next three days... It was a grim scene, my friends. EMTs with gas masks had to get him out of there, they had to medi-vac him to OHSU... anyway, he’s a cop now... Why’s everybody looking at me?</p>
<p class="character">SNORTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because the action is on you!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit! It is?! I’m so sorry, I just... you know I thought of Sweets and that whole story came rushing back, okay! My turn. Here we go. Looking at cards... looking... at... cards... I raise.</p>
<p class="character">SNORTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again?!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey. Are we playing cards or are we playing cards, here?</p>

<p class="dialogue">You just told us a five minute story about your friend shitting himself!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, that’s... guilty. I did do that. Apologies to the table, okay? But still... I raise twenty.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Every time we play, you go all in and you lose, and then split the table in half with your ridiculous axe.</p>
<p class="character">SNORTS</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have not split the table for at least three weeks AND DON’T CALL MY AXE RIDICULOUS!</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, Snorts, no need to get upset. We respect your agency, okay? I hear and I see you. Guys, Snorts is going all in, it’s his choice. Who else is coming with him?</p>

<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good morning, Hood’s Pocket, I hope everyone is feeling a little better this morning.</p>
<p class="dialogue">We know now that when we travel it can make a lot of y’all sick for a minute, so if you’re feeling under the weather get yourself down to Trikett’s. She’s got some sort of tea that will help you with the nausea. Now, I know a lot of you are really nervous because we’re still trying to get our bearings in this new place. We’ve got space ships flying over our head and yes, the rumors are true, we’ve got a group of aliens staying at the Horizon right now. I have it on good authority that they are called Truskans and they may look like big monsters, but they’re harmless. But on the topic of where the hell we are, I have some news that’s hot of the presses: We have a name for this place. Welcome, everyone to the planet of Rax Prime, just outside the capital city of Raxius. Here’s what we know: Rax Prime is in the Andromeda galaxy, isn’t that crazy? We’re in a part of Andromeda that is apparently called the Iron Quadrant. Now, listen close, here’s the deal with the Iron quadrant... Have any of y’all heard the stories about Portland at the turn of the century? Around the year 1900 Portland was made up of unemployed miners, sailors, lumberjacks, and criminals. It was known as the most dangerous place in the country, and there were a lot of dangerous places in the country back then. Organized crime, racketeering, people getting shanghaied, and it didn’t really get straightened out until World War II came along.  Anyway, try and imagine turn of the century Portland, but in space. That’s basically where we are. It’s hard living here in the Iron Quadrant, and in Raxius, the city that’s a two hour drive from us, it’s the worst of the worst. But don’t worry, they have no idea we’re here yet. And let’s try and keep it that way, okay guys?</p>

<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right, remember, if you see anything that looks weird or out of place, remember that all of our phones are connected through Eldin now. Pick up your phone, say “Eldin” and just start talking about what you’re seeing. It’ll get sent to us up here at our house, okay? We can do this, y’all, we did just fine in medieval Bavaria and we did even better in that place that I still can’t pronounce. Stay calm, stay cautious, and I will see all of you down at the Sheep’s Eye.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Look at you all ready to go and I’m still in my pajamas.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to get up higher on the mountain and have a look around. Raxius is surrounded by about a million secret criminal hideaways--I don’t want anyone getting curious.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I still don’t understand how a whole mountain appeared outside this city and no one’s noticed.</p>

<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Raxius is surrounded by a nasty mountain range called BugBug’s Teeth. We landed right in the middle of them.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But still. It’s a mountain.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Think about a huge mountain range. If another mountain showed up overnight, would you really notice?</p>

<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s up?</p>

<p class="dialogue">... How do we protect a small town of humans from a city full of the biggest scumbags in the Triad?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure the answer lies in trying to figure it all out ourselves and not relying on anyone else for help.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, fuck you. I’m growing.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>

<p class="dialogue">I’m not sure when we’ll be back home, but when we are I am going to dump some very steamy data into all sorts of knowledge bases.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>

<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh it will be.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You sure you can’t connect to the network? It’d be great to have a look around.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I could but we’d better err on the side of caution for the time being. We don’t want to attract any unnecessary attention. I’ll work off the archive in the Phoenix for now and if we have to take a peek outside our local network, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let’s remain calm. All members of Hood’s Pocket are currently in the town borders, or at least their phones are.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>

<p class="character">FRANK (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why does it take so much longer to get back than it took to get into space?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had to take a longer route so that we weren’t tracked.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine... Okay look, I just had to do a reverse-Doctor Strangelove into space to keep you from being abducted by psychotic space twins. This is what? Day five? Are we going to be able to make it through this?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, look. Remember I told you about my home planet? The one that’s a black hole now?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">When that happened, it completely screwed this part of Andromeda. It’s very hard to get in or out of the Iron Quadrant now and it’s made life very hard for a lot of people.</p>
<p class="dialogue">In an environment like that, the same thing happened that always happens: it gets taken over by some very bad people. It’s total chaos in this part of the galaxy, and the people who run it like it that way. There’s a pirate named Låfftrax. They’re incredibly powerful, they run nearly all of the crime across three galaxies. The one place they can’t seem to control? Right here. The Iron Quadrant. How we stay safe, tucked in here on this mountain? I have no idea. We need a plan, but I have no idea what that plan is.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What?</p>

<p class="dialogue">You heard me.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know it sounds crazy but the more we talked about it, the more... well, nobody else had a plan.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not a good enough reason, Doug.</p>
<p class="character">FLAT DOUG</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s what I said at first but, in the end, we opted for any plan at all over none.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>

<p class="character">EDGY STEVE</p>
