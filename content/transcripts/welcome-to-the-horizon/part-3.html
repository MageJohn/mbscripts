<p class="direction">WE ONCE AGAIN HEAR THE SOUNDS OF THE BREAKFAST RUSH AT THE SHEEP’S EYE. VERGE STANDS OUTSIDE.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just so we’re clear...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re going to sit down with these Earthlings and just... tell them everything.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know about everything but I’m going to answer their questions.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh huh...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well I’m no expert or anything.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m no expert but it does feel like this falls outside of your usual modus operandi.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Does it?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you disagree?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I slew a gigantic hell beast in their parking lot last night, I don’t think I’d be able to explain that away.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And your usual modus operandi would be to pack up immediately and head for one of many hiding spots, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I suppose.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yet.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yet.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Would you like a reminder of how vulnerable the information systems are on this planet?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not really.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone is basically walking around naked.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">From a data security perspective.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I get it.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yet.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And yet.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... One of my directives is to make sure you’re not killed.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I appreciate it, Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I’m sure you can imagine how attracting attention on this planet is in conflict with that directive.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I understand.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then what the fuck, Verge?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Relax.</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR TO THE SHEEP’S EYE OPENS AND DEIDRE EMERGES.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, a Breakfast Burrito and a short stack. Enjoy, guys... Oh, hey.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, there.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How was your night?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Interesting good?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I owe you a drink.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You do.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you come to collect?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hear drinking in the morning is frowned on around here.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe by some people, not by anyone in the four walls behind me.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alright... Do you have anything spicy in there?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...All sorts of things.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. I have to sit down with Frank and June for a bit, but I’ll come see you later.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="direction">DEIDRE WALKS BACK INSIDE.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes, it’s all becoming clear to me now.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, no, don’t mind me, don’t let me interrupt you dipping your toe in the local finery.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Finery?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The local peasantry? The local flavor? What would you like me to call it?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Call what?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, I’d love to continue this conversation but I need to, real quick, tally up the list of bounties you have on your head.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You worry too much.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">YOU worry too much. Suddenly you’re not. I don’t like it.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you going to do, tender your resignation?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">We agreed that coming here would require keeping a low profile, now you’re spilling the beans with the local proprietors and beginning some sort of mating ritual with one of the local idiots.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Quiet down. Here they come.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Verge.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello there... Heck of a night last night.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, sure, heck of a night. Why don’t we get down to business, okay?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ok.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s sit.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY PULL THREE CHAIRS OUT FROM A TABLE AND SIT. THERE IS A LONG PAUSE.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, I get the sense that if I start this conversation you’re going to want to take control of it as soon as possible so why don’t you go ahead and start?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay... What I witnessed last night, what we witnessed was you brandishing, what could only be described as, a ray-gun.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think you could find a few more ways to describe it, but yes. That is what you witnessed. And what I witnessed last night was a monstrous dog. That I killed. And when I killed it, it exploded into a dozen smaller dogs.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Twnety-one dogs, actually.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is what you saw, yes.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Afterwards I did some looking into it, and one big dog exploding into twenty one smaller dogs is NOT a common occurrence on this planet.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, and I can tell you from experience, whatever Buck Rodgers nonsense you performed last night is also not a common occurrence on this... on this planet, you said “on this planet.”</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Yes I did... buried the lede, I guess.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Holy shit.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I heard about this Earthling. Enrico Fermi. He had some theory about life on other planets. He said, if there are so many habitable planets out there, well then where is everybody?... Hi.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Frank’s going to need a minute.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take all the time you need.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I, however, do not need a minute. Let’s get into it.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re an alien.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where are you from?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Space.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s the name of your planet?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was called Vapus.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Was?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was destroyed.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your planet was destroyed?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">An experiment gone wrong.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You blew up your planet?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Kind of. It’s a black hole now.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a black hole now?!</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you survive?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was just a kid, I was on vacation with my parents.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then where do you live?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nowhere.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nowhere?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Someone described it to me once. A hobo?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. So you just kind of wander around?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not wander really. I have a complicated assortment of hideouts.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hideouts. Why are you hiding out?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bounty hunters.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...Space bounty hunters?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Holy shit. Okay. Why? Are you a space criminal attracting space bounty hunters?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t have to put “space” in front of every noun.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yes I do, Verge. Why are the space bounty hunters space hunting you?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m worth a lot of money, let’s leave it at that.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did you get here?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">In my ship.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You... you have a space ship?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s across the road from your hotel. In the trees.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Get the fuck out.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How come people can’t see it? Wait... a cloaking device?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Trying to keep it together.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is... the most awesome shit I’ve ever heard in my life!</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, how are you doing over there?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was hoping you were from the secret military base nearby.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a secret military base nearby?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... My turn?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck was happening in your parking lot last night?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It’s never been the most normal town in the world but... A few days ago a.... A diner showed up in our parking lot.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A diner?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Aha.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, it sounds ridiculous... ever since then, things have been getting a little weird here in town.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... That doesn’t sound so ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? This is a common occurrence in your world?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... It was called Midnight Burger.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit. Yes. You know what I’m talking about?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like we have a mutual friend.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We do?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Leif.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, which one was Leif?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The guy on the roof.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know him?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was the one who sent me here. He said it was a nice place, he said I might like it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do you know him?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a long story.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, Okay... I get it.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... The diner, they warned us that things were going to get weird here. Something about damage to the fabric of space/time.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They said it was going to make dogs explode into other dogs?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, they couldn’t tell us how, they just said that it might get weird.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. I think we can confirm that, right?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What else has been happening?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um...</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The other day we had an encounter with a bandit.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have bandits here?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A bandit from about a hundred and seventy-five years ago.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Relentless Rick.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Relentless Rick?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a little much.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, he was pretty relentless.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then you showed up.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But honestly, being visited by aliens is the most normal of the three.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you’re only here because you heard it was nice?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. And quiet. Which it is. If you overlook the whole two-ton dog part.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You look human.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m in disguise.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What, are you wearing a wig or something?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m wearing an Earthsuit. It disguises me on Earth.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what, you can unzip yourself and you’re a little green man on the inside?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Actually Vapians look really similar to Earthlings aside from two very key details. The Earthsuit hides those two things. Everything else is me.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are the two things?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Mind your business.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m going to go ahead and put a stop this conversation because... because what the fuck... Verge, thank you for what you did last night, I’m pretty sure we’d be dead if you hadn’t have...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Used my ray gun?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t mention it.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fucking aliens... sure.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re welcome here as long as you want okay? Just... if you’re going to plant eggs in someone’s throat or something we would like a heads up.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh Frank, it’s been years since I planted my eggs in someone’s throat, don’t worry about it.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you seriously do that?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, June.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How the fuck am I supposed to know?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit. I forgot.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have to go talk to Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh good. This means you’ll be in a great mood for the rest of the day.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamnit.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s Trinkett?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank’s favorite person.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Please God, let her not know about all of this.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course she’s going to know, she speaks to the birds and they tell her secrets.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have to go. Verge... y’know... welcome to Earth?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Frank, do you want to order something?</p>

<p class="dialogue">No, I’ve got to go, thanks.</p>

<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is happening?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay. Like I was saying, I was in Cairo, New York. I was there because I was working on a book. It’s a book about forests and the power that they hold. In Cairo, New York is fossilized evidence of the oldest forest in the history of the world. I was trying to get in touch with all of that, trying to commune with an ancient place to get a sense of its power. Things hide in forests. Not just spirits and entities but also ideas. Ideas that have been long forgotten can hide there from the modern world. They can be safe there. It’s why I live here. I know that you think I’m ridiculous. I know you like to make jokes when I proscribe an herb smoke for someone’s migraines, I know you think that my crystals and my Tarot cards are all stupid. You forget that I’m used to you making fun of me because you’ve been doing it since I was a goth in middle school.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">You looked pretty ridiculous in middle school.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know I looked ridiculous, Frank, but every goth is just a witch in training and here I am now... I’ve never expected you to believe in what I do, but now, with these very strange things happening in town, I think maybe I’m due a little respect, okay?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Okay. I apologize.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">And, not for nothing, the herb smoke worked. Celeste doesn’t have migraines anymore.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I remember.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So there I was in the middle of an ancient forest. I had just gotten my fire started and the sun was going down. I got a very strange feeling and I decided to pull some cards. And there, right in a row: The Wheel of Fortune, Death, The Tower, and Judgment... Change is coming... So the next morning I went into the nearest town and I called a friend of mine, Joshua Cody. Joshua works at the Rubin Observatory in Chile. Like a lot of astronomers, Joshua is secretly an astrologer, and will admit in private that the things that happen in the stars above our heads have a very real impact on the things that happen on Earth. I tell Joshua about this feeling I had and about the cards I pulled... And they tell me that something is happening on their end as well. Something in the sky...</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">The conventional wisdom is that it’s a series of comets that follow a similar path in the solar system, they call them X-1604 through x-1612. But people like Joshua and people like me have a different idea. The series of comets that astronomers see in the sky is just one comet. A comet with an unpredictable orbit. A comet that returns to Earth whenever it needs to. A comet that brings drastic change and upheaval. It’s called The Wayfaring Stranger.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">So this comet just waits around until it’s time to come back to Earth?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what it does in it’s free time, Frank, I’m not all up in its business.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s sounds a little impossible, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, again: Time Traveling Bandit.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Point taken.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Joshua has a few things they need to check and then I’m going to call them later today. Joshua is going to make some adjustments and do some readings and then will let me know.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let you know what?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">If The Wayfaring Stranger is returning.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if it is?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Most ancient cultures have a flood myth. These myths came into being right around the same time all around the world. That was the last time The Wayfaring Stranger visited our planet. The last time this comet passed by us, the world flooded. And later today, we’re going to find out if it’s coming back.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Trinkett, I know I’ve been dismissive of you in the past, but I’ve never thought you were stupid or naive for believing the things that you believe.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure you did.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, maybe a little, but look... Do you honestly believe that a comet is heading for Earth and there’s going to be a massive flood around the world?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, Frank. But I’ll say this: I’m glad we’re at the top of a mountain right now.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">I really don’t know what to say to that, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">This mysterious bandit that came through town, he was running from something, right?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s exodus. That’s a standard reaction to impending doom. All the dogs in town, all their spirits combining into one collective soul? That’s consolidation. That’s another standard reaction to impeding doom.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are some other reactions?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Denial. I think you’ve got that one pretty well handled, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I need more information, obviously. But if I get on the phone today and hear that The Wayfaring Stranger is coming back? I think we’re going to start seeing the people in this town reacting to something. Their spirit selves are going to be sensing something. There’s going to be denial, rebellion, acceptance, resilience, it’s going to be a lot. I honestly don’t know what we’re in for.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Denial, rebellion, acceptance, resilience. That just sounds like life to me, Trinkett.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe. Regardless, there are people in town that listen to you and there are people in town that listen to me. They’re going to need both of us.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. What happens now?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now we wait to hear. I just made nettle and ginger tea, do you want some?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">God, I really don’t.</p>
<p class="direction">BACK AT THE SHEEP’S EYE.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anybody can get pregnant?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anybody.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does that work?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Humans have sexes. Vapians don’t.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So who... how does the... wait... if you-</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Vapians, like Earthlings, reproduce through sexual contact. Unlike humans, that sexual contact can result in either partner being inseminated.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have a talking space phone?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">June this is Eldin.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It has a name?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, June. Don’t take this personally, but I think Verge is making a terrible mistake in talking to you.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nonsense, I’m great.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you have questions, Eldin is probably better at answering them than I am.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my god, are you serious?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin, how much battery life have you got?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">My current charge will last approximately eighteen Earth months.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well see, that’s already amazing, I’m constantly at a five percent charge somehow.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, lithium-ion was really one of your worst ideas.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So Eldin, tell me, how many different types of aliens are out there?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Current census data reads that there are currently 556,349 species of sentient life in The Triad.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Five... Holy shit. What’s The Triad?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Triad is “Out there”.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So what’s like, the weirdest one?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m talking to one of them right now, June.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ha! I like it. It’s kind of a dick.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Definitely.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So why don’t you want Verge talking to me, Eldin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The longer Verge stays on this planet, the greater the risk to their safety.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit. Is that true?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s exaggerating.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you exaggerating?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The worst place for a Vapian to be is in an environment with unsecured data networks. There are a lot of people out there looking for Vapians, especially this particular Vapian. One stray photo of Verge on a networked security camera could mean big trouble. This entire planet leaks data like a submarine with a screen door.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, I’ll have you know that I have never repeated a password in my life, pal.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the time it took you to say that I hacked into your phone and I now have all of your personal banking information. Do you mind if I go shopping?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jokes on you, Eldin, I don’t have any money.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is... true.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s his job to worry about things, don’t let him freak you out.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is he serious though? Is it dangerous for you to be here?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean... a little.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">A lot.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Sighing.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin, what is The Triad?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Triad is a cluster of three galaxies in close relative proximity that are connected by a series of stable wormholes. The Milky Way, Andromeda, and Trianguulum.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s where you live, okay? The Triad.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And what is the political climate right now in The Triad, Eldin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Political tensions in The Triad are at an all time high in the aftermath of a series of rebellious acts referred to colloquially as “Gloria’s War,” wherein an anomaly known as “Midnight Burger” disrupted current power structures across several systems and fomented rebellion on many planets.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The diner from our parking lot?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I owe you a much longer explanation than this but... There’s a lot going on above your head, June. A lot. And I think I know which way the wind is blowing... I think there’s going to be a war.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...A space war?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, June. A space war.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we in danger?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. That’s the whole point. This place may be dangerous for me right now, but if things go the way I think they’re going to go, Earth will be the safest place. If a war happens, it won’t touch Earth. Earth is too important to both sides.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What? We’re Switzerland or something?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eldin?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Switzerland is a nation on the continent of Europe know for its political neutrality.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure. Like that. Kind of... Eldin’s right though. For the time being it’s dangerous for me here. And if it’s dangerous for me, it’s dangerous for someone else, too. If I’m going to stay here I should probably find a place further away from people, less collateral damage.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey hey hey, no you shouldn’t. We don’t turn away business at the Horizon Motel.</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you want to be here, you should be here. Jesus Christ, Verge, you saved our lives last night, how bad would we suck if we kicked you out?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not kicking me out, I’m leaving.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, you’re not. It’s going to be fine.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">If you don’t mind me saying, you’ve been strangely fine with my situation from the moment I killed the big dog in your parking lot.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, of course I have. Look... when I would get home from school as a kid there would be these reruns of a show on TV called “Star Trek.” Have you heard of this?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think so.</p>
<p class="direction">AS JUNE TALKS, WE SLOWLY BEGIN TO HEAR THE SOUND OF A CHINESE NEW YEAR PARADE COMING UP THE STREET.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The whole thing took place in space, and there were aliens and shit, it was great. But it kind of ruined me, because everything else looked boring by comparison. I was dating this guy, and he really wanted us to move to the city. “It’s all happening there,” he would say. And I was like “Oh really? It’s all happening there? Are there Gorns there? I don’t think so.” It ruined me. It’s a cruel trick, you know? We’re given these wild imaginations while being trapped in a world that can never live up to them. But now... well, look at me now, Verge. I’m sitting here with my new alien friend who’s in danger of space bounty hunters and trying to avoid a space war. You can’t leave, Verge. It’s too awesome.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh. June?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you seeing this?</p>
<p class="direction">THE PARADE IS NOW VERY CLOSE TO THE SHEEP’S EYE. JUNE’S PHONE STARTS RINGING.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Hello, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is that coming up the street?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can see it too, huh?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re watching it with Trinkett’s telescope.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well it’s... Frankie, I have no idea what it is.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this not normal?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It looks like a Chinese New Year Parade.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre says it looks like a Chinese New Year Parade.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ve never had a Chinese New Year Parade, when is the Chinese New Year?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He says we’ve never had a Chinese New Year Parade.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We did one time.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Deidre says we did one time... wait... when was this one time, Deidre?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... 1923.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh-huh. Sure.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They held them in several towns across the state as a way to try and ease anti-Chinese sentiment.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh-huh. Well, it’s working on me, it looks like a lot of fun.</p>
<p class="direction">THE PARADE IS IN FULL SWING AS THEY PASS BY THE SHEEP’S EYE.</p>

<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Frank, this is apparently a Chinese New Year celebration from 1923.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh-huh. About a hundred years ago.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yep.</p>
<p class="direction">FIREWORKS BEGIN TO GO OFF.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oooh. They’ve got fireworks. I bet Trinkett’s got her peasant skirt in a twist about this one.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you kidding me, she’s never been more in her element. We have some news, actually. Stay put, we’re coming to you.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, enjoy the parade.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(On the phone.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You too!</p>
<p class="direction">THE PARADE HAS BEGUN TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE SHEEP’S EYE.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everybody wave.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was that all about?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I know you think you’re cool with your talking box and your space ship and your alien parts, but that was a time-traveling parade you just witnessed my space-friend. Suck on that.</p>
<p class="direction">LATER IN THE SHEEP’S EYE. A LARGE CROWD HAS GATHERED AGAIN.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Large crowd all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, hey. Yeah. I think the sudden parade outside might have attracted some attention. Please don’t ask me to explain it, by the way, I really have no idea what’s going on.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So are you the town historian, or something?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me? No. I just get interested in things. My family has been here a long time. My grandfather moved here when he was a kid and now he owns half the town.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Deidre.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Frank, what the fuck with the parade?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I know, give me a minute, okay? Verge.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is a fucked up town, Frank.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, no shit. Listen, what can you tell me about comets.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Comets?</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um. If you position your ship to the far side of one, it’s a great way to dodge long range scanners.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Anything more terrestrial? What can a comet do to a planet?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A lot. The closer it gets to a star, the more debris it sheds.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Depending on what the comet is made of, it can rain all kinds of hellfire on a planet.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goddamnit.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you’re going to call your friend Joshua in where?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Chile.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And they’re going to tell you if a comet is headed for Earth?</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And if it is, that’s bad.</p>
<p class="character">TRINKETT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It could be. There’s no way of knowing for sure.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great to have you back in town, Trinkett.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hey, another thing about comets, most cultures regard them as harbingers of doom or drastic change.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I think we’re aware of that part, Verge.</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Verge, remember how I said this is a great place and you should stay? Maybe I was wrong.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because of a comet?</p>
<p class="character">JUNE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m fine. I had a hideout on an unstable centaur for a while, that’s way more dangerous.</p>
<p class="character">FRANK</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s an unstable centaur?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A planet that could collide with another planet at any time.</p>
