<p class="direction">LATE AT NIGHT. VERGE LISTENS TO MUSIC AND SMOKES. THEY GET UP AND PACE FOR A BIT.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Humans drink warm milk.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Milk from a cow. They warm it up and it helps them sleep.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because of the peptides... Interesting bit: apparently if they milk the cow at night, the night milk works even better to help them sleep... Which raises the question, is the milk working better or are they just more exhausted from milking a cow at night?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s disturbing that they take milk from another species and drink it.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It started as a survival technique. They almost killed themselves about thirteen thousand years ago. They ate almost all the animals on the planet and had to hurry up and figure out how to stay alive. One of those ways was drinking the milk of other animals.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Weird.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s more common than you think... The first animals that humans drank the milk of were most likely sheep and goats, as well as aurochs, the ancestors of the modern cow.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s up with the milk facts?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You seem like something is wrong.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then ask me what’s wrong.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I would, but somebody, not saying who, disabled my emotional discourse protocols, so in times like these when you’re pacing around the room like a caged animal, all I have are milk facts.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Enable emotional discourse protocols.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sorry, what was that?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Enable emotional discourse protocols!</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s wrong, Verge?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know... I’m feeling antsy.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hm.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really? That’s the extent of your emotional discourse protocols?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Would you like to know why you’re feeling antsy?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Verge. You went over to that woman’s house the other day. It was supposed to be something embarrassing and ridiculous.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was, but that’s not all it was... Would you like a readout of your vital signs during that encounter?...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you know her location?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I do.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is her location?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure you-</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to throw you in the fucking toilet.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">... She’s at work.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well... Well, obviously I’m no good here, I should go for a walk.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. Walking. Of course.</p>
<p class="direction">LATER. OUTSIDE THE SHEEP’S EYE. VERGE WALKS UP AND LIGHTS ANOTHER CIGARETTE. THEY HESITATE.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is wrong with me?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re nervous.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t get nervous.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not normally, no. You have a highly acute stress response in your neural clusters that keeps you calm when you’re in danger. However, you are not in danger...</p>
<p class="dialogue">And I’m sure you’re saying to yourself “How can I be calm in a firefight and not here, outside of this bar, on a backwater planet?” Well... You ironically do not have the protection of a dangerous situation.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It sounds like you’re enjoying this.</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m an algorithm, I’m incapable of enjoying things, I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happened to you constantly telling me that being here at all is a bad idea?</p>
<p class="character">ELDIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve abandoned that line to conserve processing power. Do you have any idea how many calculations I’m making on a second by second basis?</p>
<p class="direction">THE DOOR TO THE SHEEP’S EYE FLINGS OPEN AND MUSIC AND LAUGHING SPILLS OUT, THOUGH IT’S NOT THE USUAL MUSIC AND LAUGHING WE’VE COME TO EXPECT. DEIDRE WALKS OUT WITH A CRATE FULL OF EMPTY BOTTLES AND PUTS THEM DOWN OUTSIDE.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shit shit shit shit shit. Okay deep breath.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">OH FUCK!...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hi.... Hello.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are you?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine... I’m fine.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can I have a drag of your cigarette?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Busy night?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes... Yes, you could say that.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything okay?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is everything okay... During prohibition rich people bought cabins in the woods where they could go and drink and party and not be bothered by the police.... That was uh... about a hundred years ago.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s an interesting bit of history, Deidre-</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re here.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Who’s here?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Them... From a hundred years ago, they’re here... A bunch of rich people from the city a hundred years ago are having a party at the Sheep’s Eye right now... I was hoping that they were some sort of group of historical re-enacters but, they’re too good... It’s happening. There are Flappers in the building. They’re asking for bath tub gin, this is happening.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... And you’ve just been serving them drinks?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What am I supposed to do?!</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been trying really hard to keep my head screwed on these past few weeks.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been trying to be everyone’s island of normalcy in the middle of all this and it’s getting really fucking hard, dude.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well then fuck it, Deidre. Go home. You don’t have to do this to yourself.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know. I almost did about an hour ago but... I guess it’s my island of normalcy too... I’ve smoked your entire cigarette, I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me help.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me help, we’ll get behind the bar, we’ll serve some drinks to people who are dead now and we’ll call it a night.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Really?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re amazing.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you sure?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, let’s go.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay... Okay, here we go.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, what was it like back then?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re about to find out.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE SHEEP’S EYE AND JAZZ MUSIC COMES BLARING OUT. PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING AND DANCING AND DRINKING.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoa.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s been like this for hours, I keep waiting for people to get tired. Have you ever bartended before?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay just do the best you can-</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(To the crowd.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay Cats and Kittens, listen up. Please give me your drink orders and I will then ignore your drink order and make you whatever the fuck I want, are we clear?... Excellent. You, sir, are getting whiskey. (To Deidre.) How’s that?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck, I’m doing that every day now.</p>
<p class="direction">VERGE POURS TWO SHOTS.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here. We’re instituting a “One for them, one for us” policy.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck it, let’s go.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY CLINK GLASSES AND DRINK.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Line up at the bar!</p>
<p class="direction">AS THEY TALK, VERGE AND DEIDRE POUR DRINK AFTER DRINK.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. People are talking really weird tonight, let me break it down for you.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“The Bees Knees” or “The Cat’s Pajamas”, that means great or excellent.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bees knees?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Applesauce!</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Applesauce.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It means “Nonsense!”</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Got it.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">These drinks are either “Giggle Water” or “Hooch”.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I like it.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone’s dressed up tonight so they’re wearing their “Glad Rags.”</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did they have a name for everything?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, they’re all doing something illegal right now, so they needed a lot of code words.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I definitely understand that.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Bank’s Closed!”</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Stop making out in public.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your people have a lot of code words right?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">My people?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Romani people, there’s a lot of code words, I heard.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right. My people.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Teach me some.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... Okay... If you’re in a jam, you’re “Ironed.”</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ironed. Like right now?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly. “In the Tubes”: You’re on the way.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the tubes!</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Unstable Unicorn.”</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A safe place to be, but only for a while. “Unstable unicorn.”</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Unstable Unicorn.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Back to the Black.” Starting from scratch.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Back to the black.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How about “çœrlost”. (SIR-lost)</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Blissed out. Lost in it. You meet someone, those first few weeks: çœrlost.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cool.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Sheliaked.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sheliaked?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Your emotions are in control. You’ve abandoned all logic.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I like it.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah... Me too...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m starting to enjoy myself.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I should’ve been this whole time. I really like this time period. The clothes, the music.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Also, you don’t know anybody.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You live in a town of 600 people. Everybody knows you. Look around, nobody knows you right now.</p>
<p class="direction">VERGE STARTS TO POUR THEM TWO MORE SHOTS.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I like everyone knowing me.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, but the downside of everyone knowing you is that everyone knows you, y’know?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I can be anyone I want to be right now.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. So who do you want to be?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’ll let you know.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Cheers.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY DRINK AGAIN. THE MUSIC SWELLS AND WE MOVE LATER IN THE NIGHT. OUTSIDE THE SHEEP’S EYE, THE DOOR FLINGS OPEN.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That is some impressive drinking going on in there.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How do they do it?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is what happens when you ban something. It just makes people want it.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So this “prohibition” you were talking about, they just banned booze altogether?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How did they even pull that off with people like that around?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. It was a depressing time, people were drinking too much, some bible-thumpers got a hold of the reins and all of sudden you couldn’t have a drink anymore.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh I think I know this one. And it gave raise to a massive surge in organized crime.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Exactly.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Same old song.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you for your help. I wouldn’t know what to do if you hadn’t shown up.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m having a great time.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Me too...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... How in the world did you end up here? I still don’t understand.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">A friend told me about it... Long time ago actually, one of those things that you ignore for a long time and then suddenly, one day... You’d be surprised. There’s not a lot of places like this. Out of the way. Hidden. Eyes are never on it. Most people pass through it and never notice... You can be yourself.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No one knows you here, so you can be whoever you want.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So who do you want to be?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’ll let you know.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... So is this an Unstable Unicorn?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This place?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Safe. But only for a while?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I don’t know what this place is.</p>
<p class="direction">THE MUSIC CHANGES INSIDE TO A SLOW SONG. VERGE WALKS UP TO DEIDRE.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come dance with me.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, really?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You dance?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How hard could it be?</p>
<p class="direction">SHE TAKES VERGE’S HAND, THEY WALK INSIDE AND INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DANCE FLOOR. THEY DANCE.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So... it’s official. My life has become unrecognizable.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’d that happen?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I mean, look around. My grandfather calls me a repeat offender. I kept leaving town to start my life and after a couple of years I would either get bored or fail miserably and then end up back here. Tending bar at The Sheep’s Eye. But then the other day I was talking to Frank and he thanked me for staying, when a bunch of people were leaving. He thanked me. And I had this moment where I said “Wait. Am I serving a purpose here? Am I actually contributing something positive to the world? Here? In Hood’s Pocket? The place I was always trying to get away from?” But then right before that I had this other moment where I said “Hey... wait a minute... is the hot, mysterious stranger flirting with me?”... Am I actually being seen? And it’s all happening right here. The place I was always trying to get away from. It all just showed up in my backyard. So my usual guidebook is out the window now. My life is unrecognizable.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... A little presumptuous to say I was flirting with you.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh please. “Got anything spicy in there?” C’mon... Are you always that forward with people?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a tactic. Preemptive flirting. You flirt with someone way too early so they have to take a gut check right at the beginning to see if they’re up for it. Keeps me from wasting time on people.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I passed the test?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. How are you feeling?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What’s that word you taught me... çœrlost?... How about you?...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Sheliaked.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Kiss me, Verge.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY KISS AND THE MUSIC SWELLS (SHUT UP, YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT!). WE HEAR CRICKETS AND NIGHTBIRDS AS WE TRANSITION TO DEIDRE’S HOUSE. DEIDRE’S TRUCK PULLS UP TO THE HOUSE AND THEY GET OUT. DEIDRE CLIMBS TO THE TOP OF THE PORCH STEPS AND TURNS.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you kindly for the make-out session in my truck.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pleasure’s all mine.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... Bank’s closed?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... What?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I’m thinking about who I want to be.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take your time.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... I am now going to invite you into my house.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wonderful.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am not inviting you in for coffee.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even better.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">BUT. I need you to give me sixty seconds before you walk in the door.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I desperately need to feel like someone who keeps their house clean.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I was just here a few days ago and it was a wreck.</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but you’re forgetting that we’re never speaking of that day again.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re not going to change your mind in that sixty seconds are you?</p>
<p class="character">DEIDRE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Absolutely not... Y’know what, I’m a new person tonight so I’ll say it right now: I’m making you pancakes in the morning.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>

It got to a point where walking on all fours wasn’t working anymore because sometimes you had to keep your head above the water... so you started walking on two feet. And that simple need led to the way you look right now... Verge’s planet was rocky and mountainous. So for them it was a complicated and high-tensile musculature, hollow bones to make them lighter while they climb... and more appendages. Two additional, lesser arms, further down the ribcage. Meant to cling to a cliff-face while you find the next foothold.</p>
