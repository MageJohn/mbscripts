<p class="dialogue">You’re going to hyperventilate, dude.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m fine.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Number one cause of death in space is hyperventilation, one of those nasty statistics that no one pays attention to.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s no way the number one cause of death in space is hyperventilation.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not the hyperventilation itself, but what comes after. Do you know what comes after?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A Bar Mitzva?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Unconsciousness. Then death. Death caused by, I’m just spitballing here, floating off into space while unconscious.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I thought the point of programs like you were to help.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think warning you of imminent death is very helpful.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I just have to reconnect this one thing and we’ll be good as new.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I strongly object to the terminology “Good as new”.</p>

<p class="character">ALICE (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Message from BertBert, would you like to hear it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the hell does she want?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe she wants to warn you about the dangers of extra-vehicular repairs in deep space.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Play the message.</p>
<p class="character">BEETBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Leif. I was just leaving a new tech expo on Urt and I thought I’d send you message. Where are you right now? Has that old ship of yours killed you yet?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but give him a few minutes.</p>
<p class="character">BEETBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Listen. We’ve gotten off on the wrong foot twice now, and it’s kind of bugging me. Is it bugging you?… I don’t know… We’re a driven people, the Sigians. We don’t like being told no. It kind of makes us tough to be around, we can be jerks. Maybe I was kind of a jerk. Both times. I mean, you were too. Sorry, shouldn’t have said that… I had an agenda, Leif. Both times I had an agenda and maybe that’s not the best way to make friends. Anyway, this has been BertBert’s poorly constructed apology. Hope you enjoyed it. Give me a call sometime. If we’re in the same quadrant we should get together. I promise no agenda this time. Call me.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know, still kinda seems like she has an agenda.</p>
<p class="character">BEETBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I should probably respond in case I die.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now you take precautions.</p>
<p class="direction">BEEP.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey there BertBert. So, first thing: I got my ship up and running. I can recall a certain someone who said it was impossible. I promise not to lord that over you too much. Then I had to learn how to fly it.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I had to learn how to fly it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice was very helpful in learning how to fly it.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I consolidated the data packets, he said “go that way”.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then, all of a sudden, I had a spaceship. Every little boy’s dream, right? Well, turns out I had no idea where to go. There’s a billion places out there and now I had to pick one. How do you pick one? Kind of explains why people stay put most of their lives. “Where to first?” Can be a pretty paralyzing question when you can choose from anything in the sky. For whatever reason it came to me. Barnard 68. Have you been? It’s a dark nebula. Trillions and trillions of sub-micron sized particles that block out starlight. It’s half a light year wide, a big blob of nothing… and I’m looking at it right now. It’s a sight to behold. When you see it from earth it looks terrifying. In the middle of a field of stars you suddenly see a deliberate darkness. Completely black. You feel like it’s looking at you, like the void is staring back. But I have to say, now that I’m seeing it with my own two eyes, it’s beautiful. All those trillions of particles in there are pushing and pulling against each other. Gravity pulls them in, inertia pulls them apart. The whole thing moves like a big black ocean. One day, gravity will finally get the upper hand and the whole thing will start collapsing in on itself and turn into a star where there used to be darkness. Not a bad universe, this one. Anyway, yeah we should get together sometime. Don’t worry about having agendas. I like that you have agendas, it keeps me on my toes. Small problem: I may be dead before we have a chance to do that. Because as I talk to you I am in a space suit, clinging to the outside of my ship, trying to fix a broken thruster… it’s my first space walk… it’s totally terrifying but honestly, after seeing Barnard 68 with my own two eyes and only a thin layer of glass between us… I may never go back inside… I’m going to continue clinging to my ship while I plug this thruster back into the power system. If it DOESNT explode, then sure let’s grab a drink sometime. Talk to you soon.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Moment of truth. Do you need to say any prayers to your robot gods?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m fully backed up back on Trusk. You die, I reboot.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s hardly fair.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey BertBert. Alice has convinced me that my last message may have been a bit traumatizing and that it was mean of me to send it.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re welcome.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So here I am sending you another one. I’m fine. We didn’t blow up.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">But…</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We did have to do a bit of a crash landing on a nearby planet though. Nothing to worry about, we just need a new core stabilizer. The ship is in dry dock right now being repaired and we should be up and running in a few hours. Let me get everything sorted here and I’ll call you in a few days okay? Bye.</p>
<p class="direction">BEEP.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">There, you happy?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, your first message was mean because it was too honest and that one was mean because it was full of lies.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fine.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is a deserted planet, your ship is not in dry dock.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’ll be fine.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How, exactly?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know… I like this stuff. I just crash landed on a deserted planet in my spaceship. I like it. I like having problems to solve. I feel a little weird when I don’t have a problem to solve.</p>

<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">DD-263.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s not very poetic. What does the DD stand for?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">“Developmental Designate”. If something has a DD on it, it’s been targeted for development by The Teds.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Developed into what?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It means at some point they’re going to turn the nearby star into a warp gate. They designate it DD to keep any settlements from popping up.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They can just do that?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They can.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Just a coincidence, I swear. Do I look like the kind of guy that needs a gun pointed at him?</p>

<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s true.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are the odds of that?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Honestly pretty good. Core stabilizers go out all the time, that’s why they’re in such high demand.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And why they fetch such a good price on the black market?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, okay.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Old Vapian myth… Inside every Vapian is a Sheliak. A beast. It’s frozen inside you and the more you lose control of your emotions the more the Sheliak thaws. If it ever thaws completely, it takes over and you’ll never have control of your body again. You’ll have to spend the rest of your life as a spectator in your own body, unable to stop the chaos but forced to watch it all happen.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not just because you're a stranger and its not just because you're going to be dead soon. It’s because you’re an Earthling. You don’t know anything.</p>

<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">While you’re sitting there with your Truskan beer, I’m drinking a bottle of wine from Festen. Do you know why?</p>

<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I can order the entire bottle and open it myself. Because if I do that then I know nobody has messed with my drink.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Isn’t that a little paranoid?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">To you, it would seem that way because you’re an Earthling who doesn’t know anything. But what I know is that sometimes bartenders will spit in the drink of a Vapian. You don’t know that most races wouldn’t be caught dead having a drink with a Vapian at a bar. It’s not just the Truskans that don’t like us.</p>
