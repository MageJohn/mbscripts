<p class="dialogue">Fancy meeting you here.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I’ve been calling you.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, I was in the middle of a project, I get weird in the middle of projects.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just happened to be in the neighborhood, huh?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. So I thought I would check in.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s sweet of you. No information gathering anymore?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, I’m serious, I don’t have an ulterior motive, I was just checking in.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure. Come in.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay… your place is a mess.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It is.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So are you, what’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I told you, I was in the middle of a project.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, Leif, I thought you were going to travel around for a while. I thought Trusk was just your first stop.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was going to be.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What happened? You’ve been here for months.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have I? That’s something I have to figure out. How do you guys keep track of time? If you’re hopping from planet to planet, how do you even know when things are happening? Is there a Greenwich Mean Time for The Triad or something?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, we just kind of roll with it.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Well, anyway I’ve been here. Alice, how many Earth months have I been here?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fourteen. Hi, BertBert.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, Alice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whoops. I’ve been here over a year. Alice who won the World Series?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh okay. I didn’t have a dog in that fight.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Leif-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How have you been?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How’s the spy game?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m not a spy, I’m a journalist.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I feel like if you’re a journalist but you don’t tell people you are when you meet them, that just makes you a spy.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Agree to disagree. Leif what’s going on in here? It’s a mess and it looks like the room of a psychopath, you have equations written on the wall.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">As I said, I’ve been in the middle of a project.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do I want to know what this project is?</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is 1 G. Earth gravity.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">… You made a gravity simulator?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">… When I left you on Sirius and got on that ship, I couldn’t stop counting all the things I couldn’t understand. The lack of inertia on the ship, what kind of fuel were they using, were they even using fuel, the wormhole, the life support, the list went on and on. I wanted to see a lot of things in these galaxies of yours but I know how I am. I wasn’t going to be able to focus on anything until I knew how everything worked.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Luckily you provided me with a magical rectangle that can bring me all the information I need.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s me!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So I got off the ship here on Trusk, rented a room above a bar and I started reading.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Reading what?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everything... Then after several months of that I needed to build something. So I made this.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">A gravity simulator?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yep.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">From scratch?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Wasn't so hard.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So when you were bragging about being one of the smartest people on your planet…</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t brag, BertBert… What do you think of Earth gravity?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s… nice. Bouncy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s more gravity on your planet?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. A lot more.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That explains that muscular frame of yours.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is “muscular frame” supposed to mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We should go out tonight. Celebrate. What are you doing tonight?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I came here because I thought you were dead. I have no other plans.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve been here a year and I don’t even know what happens here. What happens on Trusk?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, shipyards mostly. Truskans are really good at making ships.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ships. I want a ship.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, you don’t know how to pilot a ship.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I figured this out didn’t I?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ships are expensive. And a lot of work.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I could give it a cool name.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then there’s the licensing and don’t even get me started on the TedTube fees.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But I could give it a cool name.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey Leif?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dez, come in! This is BertBert.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, we met downstairs. Leif, everything in the kitchen is hovering.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit. Sorry. Just a few more minutes okay? Feels like home up here. Hey! Dez, we’re going out tonight.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">We are?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do Truskans do for fun around here?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh, there’s a Groogy tonight, we could go to that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Contestants show up with cannons they make at home. Then there’s eight slabs of marble. Who ever can shoot through the most slabs of marble with their home made canon wins.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh my God.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a potato gun contest?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s a potato gun?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a homemade gun. It shoots potatoes.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would anyone do that to a potato?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How often does this happen?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Any time the scrap center has a prize they can give away.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s the prize?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t say it.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Do you want to know what he’s saying?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I get the gist.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is going to be weird. I don’t think an alien’s ever competed in a Groogy before.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">They don’t do anything bad to the losers do they?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">We shame them endlessly, I feel like Leif’s going to be okay with that.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, he’ll be fine.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">… So you seem nice.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thanks?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry. The Sigians I’ve met have all been really intense.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I know. We pride ourselves on being difficult.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, why is that?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s our thing. Building starships is your thing, being difficult is our thing.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">We build starships because people need starships. Why do people need you to be difficult?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">People don’t need us to be difficult but people need… “The worst things are always hidden.” That’s what we say on Sigius. Truly evil things are rarely obvious, you have to dig them up. So you have to be a pain in the ass. Don’t take things at face value. If you don’t, they can get so deep into your life that you can’t get rid of them.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. See, that makes sense. How come Sigians never just say that?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because we’re also arrogant pricks.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I see.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So how come you don’t work in the ship yards?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s two honorable professions on Trusk. Working in the ship yards or working at the place where everyone goes to drink after working in the ship yards.</p>

<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is that?</p>

<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Holy shit.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did I win?</p>
<p class="direction">THE CROWD GOES WILD. THE SOUND OF THE CROWD FADES OUT AND THEN WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A METAL DOOR CREAKING OPEN AND ECHOING THROUGH AN EMPTY SHIP.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Here it is.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Lovely.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I suppose I should’ve mentioned that that ship you win may not be a working ship.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s fine.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a total wreck, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a diamond in the rough.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">In its day this was a really nice light cruiser. They don’t make them like this anymore.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, it’s a real marvel of engineering.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What should I do first?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not to be anticlimactic but I should probably go get a broom. It’s a mess in here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Good thinking.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m getting a very strong sense that something may be living in here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Something is living in here.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can’t live in here.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh I am definitely living in here.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, remember when you told me The Triad was going to eat me alive? How’m I doing? I made gravity today. I won a spaceship in a homemade cannon competition. I feel like I’m doing pretty well.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">… Fine. Take your Tangle and put it in that slot on the control panel.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because that’s how it works.</p>

<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can we talk about the word “new”?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you think, Alice?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a great ship.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">See?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">…Is what they would’ve said 50 years ago about this ship.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">See?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Come on. Give me some good news.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The good news is, it’s already in a scrap yard so you don’t have to take it to a scrap yard.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice, can you just tell me what the hell this ship is, please?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This WAS a Truskan Selig. A now discontinued class of star cruiser designed for small occupancy and long distances, complete with mini kitchen and small sleeping quarters.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sleeping quarters?! Where?!</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the back.</p>
<p class="direction">LEIF RUNS TO THE BACK.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the back.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck yes!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a camper van. it’s a space faring camper van. This is amazing.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, you’re taking a hard right into “Space Dirtbag” territory.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nonsense. Alice, give me a work up, how much to get it flying?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t know how to fly it, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well, there are multiple leaks in the hull, the drive core is at 30% and dropping, environmental control is nonexistent, and life support is functioning but definitely needs to be flushed because it will have a smell to it that can only be described as: farts. On top of all that the sensor web is badly damaged so there could be a whole other list of problems that I can’t detect.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds like no problem.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I give up.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s going to be great.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, do you know why they discontinued this class of ship? I mean, aside from the fact that space travel is much more economical in large groups?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because it only carries a few people, and when you’re out there in the void, things go wrong. And when things go wrong you need other people around.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. You coming with me, then?</p>
<p class="direction">BERTBERT No.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then I guess I’ll just have to make do. Sorry, the potential is just too amazing.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, I appreciate you stopping by, but I really want to get to work on this so unless you want to hand me tools-</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think I found someone else from Earth.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">… What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Darren Delvy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know that name.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s from a place called New Zealand.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah. Aerospace guy, right?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was. Now he’s living on a really nice plot of land on Nesso.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s Nesso?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leisure planet. Lots of resorts and spas.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">An entire planet of resorts and spas?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">There’s a lot of people out there, they all need a vacation. Do you remember what he was working on?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">A fission rocket, I think. Jesus, did he build it?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Theres no record of a fission rocket on earth.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">…huh.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">A fission engine would change everything on Earth.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, would’ve been nice to see one.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, you just won a fission engine in a contest.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh. Right. Lucky me.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">… You don’t think it’s a coincidence-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Jesus Christ, you’re not here to check in on me on at all, are you?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hey, I found an old bottle of Thoom. What do you call it, when you hit the bottle on the side of the ship?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m going to track him down, why don’t you come with me?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would I do that?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t want to talk to another Earthling?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve talked to plenty of Earthlings.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then do me a favor.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why would I do THAT?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Because I’m your friend.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve met you twice now. Both times you were lying to me. That doesn’t get you in the friend category.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif, what are you doing here? How did you get here? What’s your deal with The Teds? What’s going on?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">…</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">When I track this guy down, he’s going to say the same thing, isn’t he? He has a deal with The Teds that he can’t talk about. How much do you want to bet?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">…</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are The Teds messing with Earth, Leif? What do they have to gain?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t care.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t care that they’re fucking with your planet?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, I don’t care. I don’t live there anymore. I’m up here now… I think you should go.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fine. Good luck with your pile of junk.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If we ever see each other again, just be honest with me. If you’re not it’s going to be the last time I ever see you.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Same goes for you. Goodbye, Leif.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">See ya.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">… Sigians, man.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Right?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">What was she talking about, with The Teds?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">You shouldn’t do deals with The Teds, man.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Don’t worry about it. I’m fine. Besides, once I get this thing up and running, nobody will be able to catch me.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay… Well the rule on Trusk is: You buy it, you name it. You got a name for it?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Laughing.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">… Yeah, I do.</p>
