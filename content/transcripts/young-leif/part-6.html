<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You... lay eggs?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, why is that weird?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know. Truskans don’t really strike me as the egg laying type.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that mean?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">On Earth, birds lay eggs.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, and I think that’s weird.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Something flies and lays eggs, how do you trust them?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’ve got a buyer for the ice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Festen. They’re in the middle of a sunspot-induced drought and The Teds are price gouging them. We’re coming in at a quarter of the price.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Excellent.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We could charge a lot more than that.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But that would miss the point.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sorry, I keep forgetting the point when I think about the money we’re not making.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like it when people make money off of desperation.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re not going to stop that from happening.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No, but it feels good.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I think they have greenroot here, are we getting food?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Dez lays eggs.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, I know. So what? Is he carrying? Dez do you have an egg on deck?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not old enough.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you build a nest?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They put them in those pits, right?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Zigosh pits.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Big flaming pits.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re flaming?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Warmth.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s bizarre.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Said the guy sleeping with an alien every night.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Used to be we had to put the eggs by a lava flow. Way better this way.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">This is our fifth job since the casino, I think we’re in the clear with Låfftrax.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Helps that we set up shop on the other end of the system.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We should keep an eye on Låfftrax, though. I think they’re trying to control the entire Triad.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">No way. Even Emperor Bug Bug couldn’t pull that off back in the day.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What are you reading?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Earth news.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are things back home? Have they emerged from their caves yet?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone’s worried about computers switching over from the year 1999 to 2000. They’ve convinced themselves that the whole world could collapse when the new year hits.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, still in the cave.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So deep in the cave.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Message from BertBert marked “urgent”.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pass.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s she want?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">No idea.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">He’s ignoring her.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m all for that. Sigians are like rust, okay? They get everywhere you don’t want them to go.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t think she’s so bad. As Sigians go anyway.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah sure. She’s okay. I mean there’s four different kinds of rust. Some are dangerous and some are just annoying.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh really, Dez? Please tell me about the different kinds of rust.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Well you got your red, your yellow-</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">New message from BertBert marked “Fuck you, goddamn you, answer you little shit”.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay, that’s funny, what’s the message?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m sure it’s skippable.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What if she’s in trouble?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, Leif, what if she’s in trouble?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m deliberately ignoring her to keep her out of trouble.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">And that’s adorable, but it’s not like listening to the message is going to suck you into her world or something. Just listen to the message.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Play the message.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(From the tangle.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh hi. Oh hi, Leif. How are you? Since you’re still ignoring my messages I thought I would just leave you with my LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT since I am about to DIE! To you I leave NOTHING BUT MY SCORN.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the fuck is she talking about?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am a fucking prisoner awaiting fucking execution!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is this a metaphor for something?</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">In case you’re wondering if that’s a metaphor for something: IT IS NOT.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh shit.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">I am a fucking prisoner of the fucking Science Priests of fucking Moog!</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">They are about to goddamn kill me in some goddamn “cleansing ceremony”.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?!</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, if for some reason you have decided to stop being a dickhead and check your messages, this is me saying “Get. Me. The. Fuck. Out. Of. Here.” I am temporarily suspending my judgement of your criminal behavior TEMPORARILY. I am temporarily suspending it so that you can, in defiance of however many laws, break into the Temple of Enlightenment on Moog and save me from whatever killing machine I am headed towards. If you have a problem doing that, try pretending I am a huge pile of money and STEAL ME, maybe that will help... I really hate that this may be the last message I ever send.</p>
<p class="character">63RD ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the tangle)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Impure One! Give me that device!</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fuck you, you freak!</p>
<p class="character">63RD ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Give it to me!</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Leif! Fucking help me-</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">...</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That sounds bad.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, we’re not getting food then?</p>
<p class="direction">THE HUM OF THE NANCY SINATRA.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The planet of Moog is a mid sized planet in Andromeda that underwent a revolution by religious fundamentalists calling themselves the Science Priests.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Boooooo.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Science Priests rose to power during the movement dubbed “The Vapian Panic”, where multiple systems began to reject technological advancement after the planet of Vapus demonstrated the dangers of technology when they accidentally collapsed their home world into a black hole.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re welcome, everyone.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The movement died down in most corners of the Triad, except for on the planet of Moog, where the Science Priests maintain a vice-like grip on the populace using the tactics of violence, fear, and intimidation.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">They sound lovely.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re really doing this, huh?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’ll be fun.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t like these guys.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t like anybody.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I like all kinds of people.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You don’t show it.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s just how my face looks.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">If they reject technology, why do they call themselves Science Priests?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a classic switcheroo. The Science Priests reject science, so they make sure the populace stays real dumb and then they say that all science comes from them. To avoid people embracing science they just say that they ARE science.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">And when someone disagrees?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re big fans of executions, as I’m sure BertBert is now learning.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">What the heck did she do to piss them off?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It could be anything. They key to suppressing a populace is making justice totally random and unhinged.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Isn’t this going to create some sort of interstellar political incident or something?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh sure. They don’t care.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are they allowed to operate like this?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take a wild guess.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It is rumored that the Science Priests of Moog are secretly supported by The Ted Empire.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh sure, real nice.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do they get out of it?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Religious fanaticism is the tiny angry dog on the lap of despotic empires. It’s tradition.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Whatever. How are we doing this?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let’s just roll in there and start shooting people. Isn’t that what Earthlings do?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Maybe something more nuanced than that.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">If they’re keeping her at that Temple of Enlightenment place? That place is real big. How do we find her?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice, is there a map of this Temple of Enlightenment anywhere?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They reject technology, there’s probably a map but it’s probably written on a scroll somewhere or something.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does it look like from the outside?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">... On the screen.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s a big tower.</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">That thing’s filled with people awaiting execution.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’d think their lack of technology wouldn’t be a benefit, but it’s kind of an amazing defense. There’s no way of knowing what’s in there. There’s nothing to hack into.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’ve got an idea.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">We have something they want.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s that?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Me.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, that’s true.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Science Priests believe the collapsing of Vapus 10 by the Vapians was the original sin of The Triad. They allege the Vapians’ arrogance and love affair with technology caused the Vapian Collapse. Because of that, they see Vapians as a scourge, an affront to all things holy. Desperate bounty hunters will sometimes attempt to abduct Vapians and bring them to Moog for a high price.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s terrible.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">In their defense, I also see myself as an affront to all things holy, but in a good way.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">That gets us in the front door. We just need to know what to do after.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hmmm... How many explosives do we have?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I haven’t done an inventory but I’m gonna guess, rough estimate, a lot.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Um hum, um hm, um hm... I’ve got an idea.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR THE SOUND OF MONKS CHANTING.</p>
<p class="character">78TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In the PA system.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We wish a glorious day to the righteous. Begin your day as the Nth Anomaly intended: untouched, unchanged, and full of his ancient light. Praise the great simplicity of the mystery.</p>
<p class="direction">WE HEAR A MASSIVE CARGO KART BEING PUSHED ALONG THE GROUND AND COMING TO A STOP.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Uh... Hey there?</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello? What is all this?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">I got a shipment here for you.</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is it?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Looks like... Looks like some crates.</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, I can see that, what is in them?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I don’t ask a lot of questions.</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does it say on your manifest?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Let me see... No, that’s last week, give me a minute here. You know the home office always screws me with this stuff, I got a ticking clock on me every time I’m out here. Do they send me out here with the right materials? No.</p>
<p class="dialogue">They send me out here with last week’s workups and I’m sitting here saying, “put all the clocks on me you want, it’s not going to give me the right materials to do the job, am I right?</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t...</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">What am I looking for?</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">What is in the crates?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh yeah. Yeah sure. Here we go... Okay, gruel. Bovian gruel. Yeesh. This stuff’s bad, you ever had this stuff?</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s a staple of our diet.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know, I hear it’s more nutritious to eat the crate this stuff comes in than the thing itself.</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t expect technology slaves like you Truskans to understand our ways.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Fair enough. How much sauce you got to put on this stuff to make it taste like something?</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I don’t have time for this, we just received a shipment of gruel yesterday, why are we getting another one?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look pal, they don’t give me the right workup for these boxes and you think they’re going to tell me why they’re here?</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Send them back, this was obviously a mistake.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, see there, this is a one way arrangement, I bring stuff, I don’t take away stuff. You got to pay extra for the takeaway.</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Even if we didn’t order it?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look, if you didn’t order it... y’know... free gruel.</p>
<p class="character">96TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">For the love of the Anomaly. Very well. Go to the cargo lift, then down two floors to grain storage.</p>

<p class="dialogue">You got it.</p>
<p class="direction">THE CARGO CART MOVES INTO A LIFT AND BEGIN TO TRAVEL DOWN.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Okay, I’m in. How about you?</p>
<p class="direction">THE CHANTING OF THE MONKS GROWS LOUDER AS LEIF AND VERGE MOVE THROUGH THE MAIN HALL OF THE TEMPLE.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">We’re in the main hall and it’s... An experience.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Religious fanatics always get the best architects.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hopefully when I try and turn in Verge they’ll lead us to wherever they keep the prisoners. That’s when you push the button, so let us know when you’re in position.</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(In earpiece.)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, will do.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">This place is insane.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know, it makes me nauseous.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you can just walk in here with a Vapian and they give you money?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You can.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How are there any of you left?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It’s not easy money. You can wind up dead hunting a Vapian. You know that tattoo on my shoulder?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">The one with the four lines?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yeah, those four lines are dead bounty hunters.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Poor babies.</p>
<p class="character">83RD ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Glorious day to the righteous. Glorious day to the Nth Anomaly. Welcome to the Temple of Enlightenment. Oh my-</p>

<p class="dialogue">Hi there.</p>
<p class="character">83RD ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You have brought us a Vapian.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I have. Because I’m a bounty hunter.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes he is.</p>
<p class="character">83RD ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I trust the arm restraints are properly secured. It’s a very dangerous creature.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Oh yes. Very secure.</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, this is my first time at the temple, how does this work?</p>
<p class="character">83RD ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Take it down the far hall to the chamber of redemption. The Acolyte will take you to the appropriate area.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Great. Praise to the whatever.</p>
<p class="direction">THEY WALK ACROSS THE GREAT HALL.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF (CONT’D)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m getting the sense that there’s going to be some harsh words said about you during this transaction.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are you worried I’m going to get my feelings hurt?</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I never worry about that... Alice, what is this Nth Anomaly?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Science Priests believe the universe should be shrouded in mystery to maintain it’s pure state. The Nth Anomaly is a personification of the mysteries of the universe that science violates with its curiosity.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Glorious day to the righteous, how can I...</p>

<p class="dialogue">Praise the Anomaly.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Didn’t we just talk to you?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">No. Different guy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Okay. Well, I have a Vapian. What do I do now?</p>
<p class="character">52ND ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you, stranger. What a beautiful offering to The Anomaly.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Thank you, I think so too.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I hear I can get paid pretty well for a Vapian.</p>
<p class="character">52ND ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Of course. One moment please.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">... He looks exactly like the last guy I talked to.</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">They’re all clones.</p>

<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Alice?</p>
<p class="character">ALICE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The original high priest of Moog thought the most effective way to create a congregation was to just clone himself. So now you have one high priest and a hundred acolytes, all the same guy.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="dialogue">That’s correct.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">But you guys are the anti-technology guys.</p>
<p class="character">52ND ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, but this elevator has been sanctified by the Nth Anomaly.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">How does that work?</p>
<p class="character">52ND ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">When the high priest deems it necessary, a piece of technology may be cleansed in the light of The Anomaly so that it may be freely used by us here at the temple.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">So, when you really want to use something, the high priest waves his hands over it and then you can use it.</p>
<p class="character">52ND ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes, because it has been cleansed.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s convenient.</p>
<p class="character">52ND ACOLYTE</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Is it?</p>

<p class="dialogue">You got your Red Rust, AKA Hydrated oxide. That’s the most common type out there. You got an even layer of corrosion across the material. That means you’ve got too much oxygen and water exposure. Then you got Yellow Rust. Iron oxide-hydroxide. You got standing water. It’s by the sink it’s by the bathtub. Are you in a submersible? Not for long if you got yellow rust.</p>
<p class="character">46TH ACOLYTE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Why are you telling me this-</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Brown Rust, brown rust is the opposite. You got a high oxygen/low moisture combo. Not a uniform rust, it shows up it spots, okay?</p>
<p class="dialogue">Brown rust you look for when you think you’ve got contaminants in the metal. “If the rust is brown, your quality is down.” That’s what you say. THEN we got black rust-</p>

<p class="dialogue">The temple, the acolytes, the entire movement!</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>

<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">I’m confused.</p>

<p class="dialogue">It does.</p>
<p class="character">HIGH PRIEST</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope! For years I would imagine all of the secret and important things that the High Priest would do all day. Communing with the Anomaly, learning great secrets, writing great tomes of knowledge. Guess what?</p>

<p class="dialogue">Berts, you got yourself in a bit of a spot there.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Just a bit of a spot, Dez. Yes.</p>
<p class="character">LEIF</p>
<p class="dialogue">Are we ready to go?</p>
<p class="character">VERGE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Where did you go?</p>

<p class="character">DEZ</p>

<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">Truskan Reminder. You know, suddenly your ship disappears from a docking station without a trace.</p>
<p class="character">BERTBERT</p>
<p class="dialogue">What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p class="character">DEZ</p>
<p class="dialogue">On Trusk we figure, y’know, we built these ships, we can pretty much take them back any time we want.</p>
